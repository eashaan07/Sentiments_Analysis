0_0,"I admit, the great majority of films released before say 1933 are just not for me. Of the dozen or so ""major"" silents I have viewed, one I loved (The Crowd), and two were very good (The Last Command and City Lights, that latter Chaplin circa 1931).<br /><br />So I was apprehensive about this one, and humor is often difficult to appreciate (uh, enjoy) decades later. I did like the lead actors, but thought little of the film.<br /><br />One intriguing sequence. Early on, the guys are supposed to get ""de-loused"" and for about three minutes, fully dressed, do some schtick. In the background, perhaps three dozen men pass by, all naked, white and black (WWI ?), and for most, their butts, part or full backside, are shown. Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of Howard Hughes?",unsup
10000_0,"Take a low budget, inexperienced actors doubling as production staff as well as limited facilitiesand you can't expect much more than ""Time Chasers"" gives you, but you can absolutely expect a lot less. This film represents a bunch of good natured friends and neighbors coming together to collaborate on an interesting project. If your cousin had been one of those involved, you would probably think to yourself, ""ok, this movie is terrible... but a really good effort."" For all the poorly delivered dialog and ham-fisted editing, ""Time Chasers"" has great scope and ambition... and one can imagine it was necessary to shoot every scene in only one or two takes. So, I'm suggesting people cut ""Time Chasers"" some slack before they cut in the jugular. That said, I'm not sure I can ever forgive the pseudo-old lady from the grocery store for the worst delivery every wrenched from the jaws of a problematic script.",unsup
10001_0,"Everybody has seen 'Back To The Future,' right? Whether you LIKE that movie or not, you've seen an example of how to make a time-travel movie work. A torn-up poster for 'Back To The Future' shows up in this movie, representing, perhaps unintentionally, what the makers of 'Tangents' (aka 'Time Chasers') did to the time-travel formula. Then again, the movie claims to have been made in 1994, but it looks -- and sounds -- like it was produced at least ten years earlier, so maybe they achieved time-travel after all.<br /><br />Start with an intensely unappealing leading man. I mean, what woman doesn't love gangly, whiny, lantern-jawed, butt-chinned, mullet-men with Coke-bottle glasses? Oh, none of you? Prepare to tough it out, ladies, cuz that's what this movie gives you.<br /><br />Second, add a leading lady who -- while not entirely unattractive -- represents many '80s clichés: big hair, too much makeup, two different plaids, shoulder pads, acid-washed mom-jeans, etc.<br /><br />Throw in a Michael Medved look-alike who wears pink blazers with white pants, a stunningly transparent villain who talks like Mortimer Snerd and has an office that looks like a circus-themed library, and evil henchmen who have nothing better to do than direct air traffic. That's our cast, folks. Enjoy!<br /><br />I could try to explain the plot, but it will take a lot less time for you to just track down a copy of this movie and watch it yourself. If YOU figure out the plot, please don't hesitate to share it with me.<br /><br />I would strongly advise watching this movie with the help of the folks at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I don't think it could stand on its own.<br /><br />The film, 'Tangents': 3 stars -- at least they tried.<br /><br />MST3K's 'Time Chasers' episode: 8 stars -- they actually succeeded.",unsup
10002_0,Doris Day was an icon of beauty in singing and acting by her warm voice and genius acting in different movies obtained this film by her legend songs as (Iwill never stop loving you) with soft melody and warm lyrics by magic voice of Day.<br /><br />James Cagney was a villain of Hollywood by shark eyes and voice to send for audience the core of badness and evil characters as his profile in cinema.The producer choose previously Ava Gardener to be the hero of this film in-front Cagney but Cagney refused this choose because he said that Gardner not familiar with his role and he cheesed Day in it because of her fantastic abilities between singing and acting and she succeeded in it with Cagney.,unsup
10003_0,"After a series of silly, fun-loving movies, 1955 was a big year for Doris Day. That year saw her handed the role of singer Ruth Etting, who made it to the top but whose personal life suffered for her success.<br /><br />The film begins with a chance meeting by Etting at a dime-a-dance joint with gangster Martin Snyder, brilliantly played by James Cagney. Cagney, with his connections, brings stardom to Etting, but she loses her freedom to a miserable existence dominated by Snyder, who ultimately marries her, after a memorable fight on opening night at the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />Day's singing was never better. In addition to the old Etting favorites, she sings the new song I'll Never Stop Loving You.<br /><br />Cowboy movie actor, Cameron Mitchell, turns in an equally strong performance as piano player, Johnny Alderman, who leaves Etting, out of disgust for the way she is being dominated, only to encounter her years later, when the two of them are working on a movie. Their revived romance leads to near tragedy.<br /><br />Cagney received a well-deserved Oscar Nomination. To this day, I'll never understand why Day and the film were overlooked for Oscar nominations.",unsup
10004_0,"This isn't exactly a musical, but it almost seems like one because there more singing than much else, but this is obviously one of the hooks. Basically one day in a bar that she used to work in, Ruth Etting (Doris Day) met producer Martin Snyder (Oscar nominated James Cagney) who could promise a new and better paid career on stage. She doesn't get in to it immediately as she is on for a few seconds, but she soon gets the chance for longer shows. She enjoys herself and the critics and producers are throwing offers at her. Later, after marriage Ruth and Martin get even bigger and she has become one of the most successful women on stage, and her career soon comes to Hollywood. It is only she discovers an old friend (near love) is working on the film, Johnny Alderman (Cameron Mitchell) that things go a bit pear shaped for her and the marriage/relationship with Martin. Also starring Robert Keith as Bernard V. Loomis, Tom Tully as Frobisher and Harry Bellaver as Georgie. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""I'll Never Stop Loving You"", Best Music for Percy Faith and George E. Stoll, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay. Doris Day was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and James Cagney was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!",unsup
10005_0,"After seven years and seventeen pictures at Warner Brothers, Doris Day moved to MGM to star in a dramatic musical based on the life of 30s singing star, Ruth Etting. The film was called ""Love Me or Leave Me"" and would co-star James Cagney. Shot in CinemaScope and Technicolor, it was a lavish film.<br /><br />Doris Day gave the performance of her career and matched the great James Cagney in the acting department. The critics were raving loud and clear and rumors of Oscars for Miss Day and Cagney were often discussed.<br /><br />The story concerned a young singing hopeful, Ruth Etting, in 20s Chicago who meets a tough gangster, Martin Snyder, who strong-arms her to fame. First in nightclubs, then radio, the Zigfield Follies in New York and finally, Hollywood films.<br /><br />James Cagney attacked the role of Snyder with frightening realism. His experience as an actor culminated in an explosive performance and garnered him a Best Actor Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Doris Day, the first actress to get billing over Cagney in over 30 years, deserved a nomination, but lost out to Eleanor Parker in ""Interrupted Melody"", also at MGM. She was remarkable throughout most of the film. There were times when she lost character and broke into her ""girl next door"" personality but those mistakes were few, however, and I'm sure when Miss Day sees the film today, she could kick herself.<br /><br />She is the showcase of the film, however, and delivers, vocally, some beautiful music. In addition to the Etting standards, two new songs were added. ""I'll Never Stop Loving You"", which became a big record hit for Miss Day and an Oscar nominee for Best Song, and ""Never Look Back"", a gorgeous ballad done with a full orchestra.<br /><br />Her big extravagant Follies number, ""Shaking the Blues Away"" was typical MGM and a far cry from anything she did at Warner Brothers.<br /><br />Cameron Mitchell as Johnny Alderman, the musical director who loves Etting, Harry Bellaver, Robert Keith and Tom Tully were all first rate. Even Veda Ann Borg in a walk-on, was fun.<br /><br />I loved this picture and recommend it highly. You won't see Doris Day used to better advantage than here. She and Cagney were excellent together, and memorable.",unsup
10006_0,"In the 1950's there were many film boigraphies: For me 4 are memorable: Interrupted Melody with Eleanor Parker/ The Great Caruso with Mario Lanza/ With A Song In My Heart with Susan Hayward and Love Me or Leave Me with Doris Day...Im commenting here on the last mentioned. what a film what a cast...what music !!!Saw this when I was @ 9yrs old, and never forgot...the sets the costumes, and Doris Day... what an underraed talent... with all her wonderful films, has only been Oscar nominated once, acted beautifully and sang her heart out! Strange that 2 other biopics I mentioned,neither Ms. Hayward nor Ms. Parker did their own singing.. and both were oscar nominated!!(love them both but Doris did it all) She has never won a major award!!Cmon Oscar its time to honor Doris Day with a special Oscar she more than deserves!! and Grammy shouldnt Doris Day be in the Hall of Fame by now ? Her recordings incl. soundtrack of LMOLM sold millions, Que Sera Sera Secret Love... Love you Doris you deserve to be honored and recognized!! also James Cagney was brilliant as well/good chemistry between both leads... buy the video/ get the soundtrack.. if available. i still have my original vinyl lp with that great Doris Day cover !!Love this film !!",unsup
10007_0,"MY RATING- 7.3<br /><br />This one is a curious mov made when James Cagney had already left his crime movs. It also stars the popular Doris Day as the singer who is sponsored by him. Cagney gets his crime movs touches to create a gangster who loves Doris Day in his way. In the end, she'll stay with Cameron Mitchell. I never liked too much Day, cause of her image too `goodie goodie' yet she proves to be a good actress here. She sings some fine songs like one of my faves-`Shakin the Blues Away'.",unsup
10008_0,"Doris Day and James Cagney are excellent in this lush Technicolor story that details the career of singer Ruth Etting. Day's bright, cheerful, optimistic, happy persona gradually gives way to depression and alcoholism brought on by the demands of a small-time hood who gains control of the singer's professional and personal life. Day's one desire is to sing and to make it big in show business, and her mentor opens doors for her but at the same time exacts a terrible price from the singer. Cagney is great as the controlling and abusive hoodlum and paints him with most unflattering strokes, yet generates a bit of sympathy because he is so pathetic as he clings to Day in desperation. Cameron Mitchell has a nice turn as Day's accompanist and love interest, playing him with warmth and sincerity. Robert Keith is also good as an agent who has first-hand knowledge of Day's unhappy personal life.",unsup
10009_0,"LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME is not your typical musical. That is, no one breaks out in song and dance. The numbers are used in the context of the story either in rehearsal or performance. This is a musical drama. Don't know how accurate the story is of Ruth Ettings rise to fame with the help of her manager/gangster/husband, but for it's day, made in the 50's, it's quite blunt. Doris Day and James Cagney have seldom been better, and they make a terrific combo. Also appealing is the underrated Cameron Mitchell, so good in HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE. Here he gives a laid back, easy going performance which is great contrast to the Marty Snyder character played by Cagney. Like in A STAR IS BORN, there really isn't anyone else of any importance in the movie. Just three or four main characters. To fully enjoy this movie, hope one has a wide screen TV for the full CinemaScope range. Stero system would also help. The musical numbers are brilliantly staged, both the big production number and Miss Days quieter moments. Correction in other peoples comments. Susan Hayward did not win her Oscar for I'LL CRY TOMORROW released the same year as LOVE ME. She won a few years later for I WANT TO LIVE...also, someone said her voice was dubbed for I'LL CRY..not so. She did her own singing as Lillian Roth...Miss Hayward WAS dubbed by Jane Froman, however, in WITH A SONG IN MY HEART... <br /><br />.",unsup
1000_0,"I have to say when a name like Zombiegeddon and an atom bomb on the front cover I was expecting a flat out chop-socky fung-ku, but what I got instead was a comedy. So, it wasn't quite was I was expecting, but I really liked it anyway! The best scene ever was the main cop dude pulling those kids over and pulling a Bad Lieutenant on them!! I was laughing my ass off. I mean, the cops were just so bad! And when I say bad, I mean The Shield Vic Macky bad. But unlike that show I was laughing when they shot people and smoked dope.<br /><br />Felissa Rose...man, oh man. What can you say about that hottie. She was great and put those other actresses to shame. She should work more often!!!!! I also really liked the fight scene outside of the building. That was done really well. Lots of fighting and people getting their heads banged up. FUN! Last, but not least Joe Estevez and William Smith were great as the...well, I wasn't sure what they were, but they seemed to be having fun and throwing out lines. I mean, some of it didn't make sense with the rest of the flick, but who cares when you're laughing so hard! All in all the film wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I wasn't expecting that. It was a Troma flick so I figured it would totally suck. It's nice when something surprises you but not totally sucking.<br /><br />Rent it if you want to get stoned on a Friday night and laugh with your buddies. Don't rent it if you are an uptight weenie or want a zombie movie with lots of flesh eating.<br /><br />P.S. Uwe Boil was a nice touch.",unsup
10010_0,"This film is the story of 20's singer Ruth Etting and her marriage to Marty Snyder. When Doris sings the old standards,it's great but MGM tacked on two numbers that sounded OK but they threw the ambiance off. It plays with the facts as usual,Ruth Etting was well into her thirties before she went Hollywood. In real life Ruth Etting was a quiet,refined woman stuck in a bad marriage. Despite what the film says,Ruth had many friends who just accepted Marty as her husband. Ruth was no ambitious tramp conniving people out of work so she could take their place but I guess it made a better story. The song Ten Cents a Dance was actually written for a stage show.",unsup
10011_0,"I've rarely been impressed by the Cinerama style of film-making. While I'm sure that the gigantic scope and vivid color made for a great experience at the time, it often doesn't stand up today. ""Love Me or Leave Me"" is one of the few such films of real quality, due in no small part to the presence of James Cagney and Doris Day. Few have seen any of Doris Day's dramatic efforts. After all, this is only one of a handful of dramas she made (others including ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""Young Man with a Horn"", and ""Storm Warning""). James Cagney is most impressive in an almost standard role (for him), but covers an interesting level of emotion.<br /><br />In the end, it's a very interesting and entertaining spectacle. Charles Vidor's direction, though rather static, is fantastic and showcases his stars well.<br /><br />7.5 out of 10",unsup
10012_0,"Some films, for all the critical praise they receive, simply pass underneath the popular radar. 'Love Me Or Leave Me', Charles Vidor's masterpiece, is one of those films. It is the greatest musical Doris Day was ever involved with, yet it doesn't seem to command the same devotion as 'Calamity Jane', an entertaining but unsatisfying comic romp, or even the lumpen 'Moonlight' movies. That's a great pity, because this film contains one of the two extraordinary dramatic performances Day delivered in the mid-fifties (the other was in 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'). In her earlier musicals, Day was an energising presence, but slightly overstated and eager as a comedienne. She was still the best thing on screen, but she lacked subtlety as an actress. Here, she's in a whole new league. Just look at the scene in which James Cagney tells her that she's going to be a Hollywood star. Her apathy is something unimaginable in Day previously, a weary cynicism expertly underplayed. Having seen this film, I don't think it's hyperbole to talk about her as being the equal of Judy Garland as an actress, if maybe not quite as a singer (although her expressive, surprisingly sensual voice makes all her other peers look suitably weak - particularly as most of them were being dubbed anyway).<br /><br />She holds her own against a Cagney at full tilt, which is no mean feat (no other actor is so able to blow other stars off the screen, with the possible exception of Al Pacino). He plays Martin Snyder as a dynamic combination of ego and insecurity, all macho bluster and hair-trigger temper. He's a monster, yet one who becomes increasingly sympathetic as the nature of his failings becomes apparent. He's a man looking for self-respect, but he can't find any - he's ridden to success on the talents of Day's Ruth Etting - so he tries to demand it from everybody else. The film doesn't soft-peddle his repellent egotism - his behaviour at the Ziegfield theatre is both intimidating and pathetic - and for the most part the audience takes Etting's side. There's a great moment shortly after the characters arrive in LA and he's been throwing his weight around, when she punctures him mid-boast. 'Just who do you think you are?' she demands, pointing out how little he's achieved compared to those he tries to intimidate. He deflates, and it's so satisfying the audience wants to cheer. Yet the movie is too complex merely to point the finger - Etting does owe much of her success to him, for all his mistreatment (and, at times, mismanagement) of her, something she realises even as the audience urges her to leave him in her wake. There's another wonderful scene, towards the end, when Robert Keith's Loomis checks Snyder's fury and tells him to, essentially, get over his own fragile ego. Etting knows she owes him - now he has to be big enough to let her pay it back. Just for a moment, it seems as though he really will change, but the film is too canny for any sort of pat resolution. He remains an egotistical heel to the end.<br /><br />The cinematography for this film is sublime, dark and rich in a way that's reminiscent of Vincente Minnelli. The film, however, is altogether less fatuous then that director's most famous works ('Meet Me In St. Louis' is visually beautiful but sentimental and patronising). A better comparison is George Cukor's 'A Star is Born', released the previous year, which matches the velvety style with dramatic teeth. The musical numbers are as good as those in any other musical of the period - particularly 'Chasin' the Blues Away' at the Ziegfield, and the final performance of 'Love Me or Leave Me'.<br /><br />This isn't just Vidor's last great film, it's probably his greatest film (and yes, I do remember 'Gilda' - but even that film doesn't have such a satisfying dramatic shape). The open ending is a device that too few films of the period used, but the tension between resolution (Etting is paying off her debt to Snyder in preparation for a future without him) and unresolved questions (Will he go to prison? Will his club be a success?) is oddly satisfying - all biographical pictures should be as open about their inability to provide neat closure to a life. The final shot of Day, singing 'Love Me or Leave Me' as the camera draws back, is one of the Hollywood's (few) great endings.",unsup
10013_0,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said, so how 'bout some background information. If you're up on your Hollywood History, you know that many stars who were chosen for a film were replaced for certain reasons, but if Jasmes Cagney had not been under suspension at Warners, he would have played Robin Hood instead of Errol Flynn. Barbra Streisand originally wanted Elvis Presley for her version of A Star Is Born and he would have been great and the film would have been a lot better, but the Colonel wouldn't have it. Judy Garland originally wanted Cary Grant for A Star Is Born and personally, I think he would have far better in the role of Norman Main. After Judy Garland was fired from Annie Get Your Gun, the first person that they wanted to play Annie was Betty Garrett, but because of her an-gent she lost out having the role of a lifetime in the movies, and after this happened, Betty Garble wanted to play Annie in the worst way, but 20th Century wouldn't lend her out, so finally after seeing Betty Hutton in The Perils of Pauline, she was hired to play Annie. Originally, Audrey Hepburn was the not the first choice for Breakfast at Tiffany's, instead they wanted Marily Monroe, and she would have been great, but her schedule wouldn't allow, and many others lost out to roles like these did. So, what does this have to do with Love Me Or Leave Me. In Jane Russells Autobiograpy she said that she was offered the part of Ruth Etting but had a choice between that project and another and her an-gent kept telling her, ""Do Love Me Or Leave Me"", but in the long run Doris Day was given the role. Personally, I can see Jane Russell playing Ruth Etting to the hilt. She would have been great. She would have matched Cagny scene for scene and been up to Cagney and his scene stealing, and she could have sung those songs, but, alas, Doris Day got the role and in the long run set her up at Metro for many years into the future! We're very proud of our Doris Kapplehoff, Price Hill girl, from here in Cincinnati, Ohio!",unsup
10014_0,"James Cagney is always a delight to watch, even when he's playing a pompous and disgusting pig like Marty Snyder. If you don't agree with that statement, you may have a hard time taking in Love Me Or Leave Me, because Cagney's character is about as unlikeable as leading men come. I know next to nothing about Snyder's non-fiction life, but if we are to believe his composite in this film, the dude must have been completely lacking redeeming qualities of any kind.<br /><br />Of course, Cagney himself is well known as one of the nicest, most decent human beings who ever worked in Hollywood, so the fact that he so effectively channels Snyder's loathsome persona certainly demonstrates the actor's tremendous skills. If you've seen any of Cagney films, you're probably used to those, but his ability to own every scene he's in despite the fact that the audience is destined to abhor his character shows very clearly how fully Cagney leaped into every performance he undertook. <br /><br />Doris Day is not one of my favorite actresses of the classic era, but she is excellent here. Perhaps I just hadn't seen her at her best until now, but after witnessing her show-stopping Zigfield Follies number here, I'm a believer. It's hard to sell her as a sympathetic character, especially watching her maintain her timid vigil under Snyder's dominating and abusive umbrella, but the film explores their volatile relationship in such depth, some semblance of understanding creeps through. This is not your traditional love story however, and in fact that emotion seems to have very little to do with the pairing on the screen in Love Me Or Leave Me. The film instead essays a very peculiar mutual dependency, and it's a fascinating relationship to digest in the hands of these two gifted actors, both of whom make every scene they share sizzle as they play off of each other.<br /><br />A substantial number of musical performances pad the running time, and it could be argued that some could have been omitted for the sake of streamlining the story. But the songs serve as external monologues in which Day fills in the emotional gaps in her character's psyche, and paying close attention to the words reveals a lot about the unspoken undercurrent of alternating disgust and devotion that seems to have classified this co-dependent arrangement. Luckily, all of the music is excellent, and Day's performances are all top notch. Whether we're seeing her headline elaborate stage numbers or simply rehearsing by the piano, her plain but effective vocal delivery always seethes with emotion.<br /><br />Though the film is definitely dated, it has aged quite well. Today's audiences will likely note the casual misogyny that runs rampant throughout the film, which was so prevalent in early Hollywood and was somehow accepted as part of popular culture. Those not familiar with this phenomenon may be a bit shocked by what they see here, but if we put it in context with the times and consider what a woman's role was traditionally considered in the era, it's not off-putting to see Day endure these verbal and emotional attacks without retaliation. It certainly doesn't dilute the strength of her performance, or the character for that matter, and knowing that it wasn't considered socially proper for a woman to talk back to her fella in those days adds yet another layer of complexity to the fabric of this union. We know there will come a point where Day finally can't take anymore, and watching her soak up each new trespass while being forced to bottle her emotions allows us to truly be engulfed by the inner turmoil of this woman whose dreams are coming true, even as her life away from the stage is a nightmare.<br /><br />This is an engrossing character study on both sides, and Day and Cagney are both in top form here. If that alone isn't enough to persuade you to watch this film, I'm at a loss to provide a better selling point.",unsup
10015_0,"In 1955, at almost the chronological mid-point of her film career (1948-1968) Doris Day made what are arguably the two finest films in which she ever appeared, Young At Heart and Love Me Or Leave Me. Both are best classified as Musical Drama and in both she played opposite a character whose screen name was Barney. If co-star Frank Sinatra got to sing the cream of the score in Young At Heart - Just One Of Those Things, Someone To Watch Over Me, One For My Baby, whilst she was stuck with the crowd-pleasing cotton candy confection - Ready, Willing And Able, Hold Me In Your Arms - with which she was identified, in Love Me or Leave Me she got to perform virtually the whole score, which, though not boasting anything like the quality of the Sinatra numbers in YAH was not exactly chopped liver. In both films she was obliged to abandon the role of professional virgin with which she was also identified in favor of semi-pro actress and in both films she managed reasonably well. LOLM is based partly on fact: Singer Ruth Etting did marry Martyn Snyder in 1922 and remained married until 1937; the following year she married Myrl Alderman, remaining married to him until his death in 1966. Whether events were as dramatic as portrayed here is speculative. Suffice it to say that though Cagney walks away with the picture as you would expect Day is only three or four steps behind while Robert Keith (who had played her father in YAH) scores well in the thankless nice-guy role as an agent. Good to watch, good to listen to, what more can I say.",unsup
10016_0,"Curiously enough after I viewed my VHS copy of Love Me or Leave Me, I went to the movies and saw Walk the Line. One of the things that struck me was that while Joaquin Phoenix had a much tougher job because Johnny Cash was performing almost up to the end and had a distinctive sound that I didn't think anyone could match, Phoenix did a very good job in capturing him.<br /><br />On the other hand Ruth Etting had not been seen in films for over 20 years, nor had she made a record in that length of time either. She was living very quietly in retirement. So except with older members of the public, Doris Day did not have to compete with an image people had in their minds.<br /><br />Also people left out of this story include Martin Snyder's first wife and his daughter from that marriage. Also the fact that Snyder was Jewish. My guess is that MGM did not want a false issue of anti-Semitism raised.<br /><br />There sure were enough issues anyway. Ruth Etting, a girl from the sticks with lots of singing talent, is determined to succeed. So she latches on to a small time Chicago hood named Martin Snyder who gets her career started and in gear.<br /><br />I remember reading that in her life with Snyder, Etting found it impossible to socialize due to Snyder's boorish behavior. One of the few other show business personalities that she did socialize with was her co-star in Kid Boots on Broadway, Eddie Cantor. Cantor who was brought up on the Lower East Side of New York, lived with guys like Snyder in his youth so he was used to it and put up with him. Very few others would.<br /><br />Incidentally the title tune Love Me or Leave Me comes from the score of Kid Boots.<br /><br />In Love Me or Leave Me, we don't have Doris doing an imitation of Ruth Etting, we have Doris singing like Doris which is just fine for me. She sings the songs that were identified with Etting very well. The album for this film sold very well for her.<br /><br />James Cagney made his third and final trip to the Oscar Derby with his portrayal of Martin ""the gimp"" Snyder. In its way Snyder is as complex a role as Cagney's Cody Jarrett. He's an uneducated kid from the slums who made it in the rackets, but feels terribly inferior around all the show business creative types that his wife now by necessity has to associate with, where ironically due to his drive has pushed her there. Cagney lost the Oscar race to Ernest Borgnine for Marty. Ain't that a piece of irony itself.<br /><br />Cameron Mitchell as Johnny Alderman (real first name Myrl) does very well as the man who eventually became her second husband as does the rest of the cast.<br /><br />All three of the people that Day, Cagney, and Mitchell portray were still alive at the time that Love Me or Leave me was being filmed. All signed off on the picture, I assume all parties were satisfied with it. <br /><br />And so should you.",unsup
10017_0,"Having seen this movie more often than all others, and one of those you will never forget the theater in which you saw it the first time, it undoubtedly is Doris Day's best. I am one of many who also feel she deserved an academy award for her portrayal of Ruth Etting. With her tremendous voice, and the acting skills she demonstrated in this role, one can only imagine what she would have done had she been one of the MGM stars, when their musicals were known as the best. I understand she came within a hair of being cast in South Pacific, but as has been rumored, it was either Marty Melcher's insistence on a much higher salary, or a clash between Doris or Marty with the director. From reading her biography, it is very apparent that she wasn't one of your typical Hollywood stars. With these typical stars and directors, as well as most everyone else associated with the AMPAS being those who decide who be will be nominated, as well as ultimately winning, Ms. Day's choice of living a less typical Hollywood life style may have had some bearing on her not being nominated for Love Me or Leave Me. I definitely believe this is the reason she has never been given a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Let us hope this award will be made before this gracious and lovely lady is unable to make an appearance there.",unsup
10018_0,"The original theatrical trailer calls James Cagney's portrayal of Marty 'The Gimp' Snyder an 'aggressive characterization'. However it's one thing to see Cagney as a gritty mobster in films like ""Public Enemy"" and ""White Heat"" where his aggression is expressed as an enemy of society. Here he seems an even more threatening presence in a one on one situation with his protégé Ruth Etting (Doris Day), a torch singer who got her start in 1920's era Chicago. It's such an effective performance that for once, I almost began to dislike him as an actor, which probably goes a long way to explain just how amazing he actually was.<br /><br />The film also keeps you a bit off balance, as the drama and personal turmoil between Ruth and Marty is offset by a whole host of musical numbers during Etting's rise to stardom. Acting as her mentor and personal manager, Snyder gets it almost right when he states ""Why just have half of Chicago when she can have all of New York"", as he lands Etting a gig with the Ziegfield Follies. Leaving Chicago however is the beginning of the end for the couple, as Snyder's power and influence mean nothing outside his home territory. Rebuffed by business managers and show people, Marty's comeuppance spells disaster, ultimately leading to the movie's title song finale to a packed house. In one last recognition of the impact Marty had on her career, Ruth repays the favor by headlining his new club, allowing him at least one more turn in the spotlight.<br /><br />It's unusual to see Doris Day in the role of Ruth Etting, one associates her with lighter and more whimsical screen characters, but she's effective here nonetheless. Her song numbers reflect the progress of Etting's career and her relationship with Marty with titles like 'Ten Cents a Dance', 'Mean To Me', 'I'll Never Stop Loving You', and in the wind up, 'Love Me Or Leave Me'. It's not your typical 'feel good' story by the time it's all over, nor does it try to be. One thing is certain though, and that's the sentiment expressed to Marty Snyder just before the curtain falls - ""You gotta give her credit, the girl can sing...""",unsup
10019_0,"A belter of a musical / drama with Day and Cagney in contrastingly powerhouse roles. My folks have long urged me to watch this movie to see the other side of Ms Day and here she deliver grits, not ditz, to great effect. She looks genuinely sexy in her scenes, not a word often used to describe her screen persona. Her singing too is terrific and almost all the songs are great, although a little artistic control might have seen fit to drop ""Sam the Accordion Man"". Cagney is, well Cagney, rampaging through the movie, slugging everyone in sight, including Day. I think the film was right to depict him with almost no redeeming features up until, I suppose, the obligatory happy ending - you feel he doesn't deserve the good turn that Day / Etting pays him when his new club opens. The only problem for me with continuity in the film is one minute Cagney's forcing himself onto Day at her moment of greatest repulsion to him and the next they're married. Did I nod off or something? By the way I've noticed that hardly any of the reviews here mention the young Cameron (""Buck Cannon"") Mitchell as the triangular love interest. In contrast to Cagney's overblown characterisation, he subtly underplays his part and is clearly in sympatico with Day in their scenes together. However, he really should get his hands closer to the dummy keyboard in the song set-pieces! In fact it's a real shame that Day didn't continue in this vein of acting, as many have said, but also, for me, that Mitchell subsided into hack television work. What else? Well, the dialogue is realistic, smart and sassy, the sets sumptuous and the direction well paced. I too can't understand why Cagney and not Day (or Mitchell come to that) got the Oscar nomination. ""Love me or Leave Me"" is a refreshing contrast to the Rodgers / Hammerstein musicals of the times with its candid depiction of 20s and 30s America, surely one of the most fascinating and exciting times ever.",unsup
1001_0,"IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS, DO NOT READ ON. THANK YOU.<br /><br />I'll be honest with you. I went into the video store looking for something mildly bad, but funny enough to keep myself entertained. The DVD starts off hilariously, with a rapidly-moving movie about zombie chickens, making me laugh in hilarity. This went on for so long, I was happily munching on my hot pocket... until it said it was a preview. This was followed by another long one, which, thanks to the genius programmers, I couldn't skip passed, so I had to FastForward. Then I finally got to the menu, which surprised me, to be frank. For the price I got it at, I wasn't expecting that much. The movie started with Lloyd Kaufman, an eccentric Jewish man who is the father of a few cult films, which made me excited. Generally, anything with Troma on it will elicit a ""what?"" response, which is what keeps me going. After Kaufman speaks with a few cute girls at some horror expo, the movie begins. Well, not quite. After play, some guys talk about how big a, I quote exactly, a ""POS"" this movie was. This goes on for awhile until I skip ahead.<br /><br />First thing I can't help but notice is that the camera and lighting work is about as good as your typical soap opera, and sometimes won't even sit still.<br /><br />The movie starts off jarringly, but no one cares. Two cops kill a guy, and put in some framing guns, though later they just shoot people for fun. Not even five minutes in, a woman disrobes, meaning someone is about to die. Naked chicks are always a signal something big is about to go down. They're in the gym of a community college, and one of them, I'll say, isn't particularly bad to look at. any arousal is quickly doused by the biker-chick esquire woman who supposedly gets hit on a lot. All of this is just filler, until the cuter woman goes in the shower, disappears when a hand grabs her, and some juice is tossed at the shower wall. I should mention, the sound is appalling in this scene. It's not award winning in any others, but the gym is inexcusable. Kaufman also plays an overacting janitor, supposedly has the biggest case of homophobia on earth because he thinks, I'm not kidding, that a man being eaten by another man is totally normal, homosexual behavior.<br /><br />These zombies are not really zombies at all. They can choose to reveal themselves, they are sentient, intelligent, and well skilled in combat. Hell, they're demons, I have no idea where they got zombies from. We learn this when a guy who hates late fees kills the clerk by cheaply ripping his heart out, and eating it when charged.<br /><br />We return to the cops, who may as well be named Good Cop and Bad Cop, since it doesn't matter. I actually had to take notes throughout this whole thing, and to run through them all would fill up the amount of characters I have available. so, I'll lay out a few of the more glaring memories: There's a pointless scene where the bad cop humps to orgasm a car driven by a group of four college kids after belittling them. There's also a lengthy conversation about testicles and the eating of said organs. There's also a running comment that no one should be in the college ""at these hours,"" often through a truly pointless subplot about some jerk-turned-good guy who saves a girl he likes, who works inventory at a book store. despite the implication that it is pretty late at night, it's always broad daylight outside. Most of the killing early on is done by the Bad cop, who is in fact a good guy. The zombies are also major wusses, who can be defeated by a few punches. There's a half decent fight scene between Sensei Zombie (a kung fu master undead) and the good cop after they rescue three useless girls. After this, they go into a safe house occupied by God. Despite being a safe house, every one inside it eventually dies. There's a few other things, I could mention, but I'd like to skip to the ultimate fight of good v. evil: Good cop is supposedly a warrior of God, because of his blood line. He fights the head zombie, which consists of him getting his punch caught, and then ripping the head zombie's heart out. Think they could've made this scene, the climax, a bit more interesting? I don't know. The movie ends with the guy getting gunned down, and zombies swarming the world.<br /><br />Wow. This is one of the first movies they ever made me stare at the screen speechless, before bursting out into laughter. ""What the hell is this?""<br /><br />What is this? This is a major piece of crap. If you're a fan of that, well, perhaps you should look into it. But, the main stream movie-goer will probably want to commit suicide after watching this, so by all means avoid.<br /><br />Main stream: 1/10 <br /><br />Masochistic Movie-Geek: 10/10",unsup
10020_0,"During the late 1940s and early 1950s musicals acquired a distinctly noir-ish quality, and the life of singer Ruth Etting was made to order.<br /><br />Born in 1896, Etting was a hardknocks chorus girl when she caught the eye of small-time Chicago hood Martin ""Moe the Gimp"" Snyder, who married her in 1922 and proceeded to promote her career--occasionally, according to rumor, at gun point. By 1927 Etting was a popular singer and a major Broadway star, and when talkies arrived the couple moved to California, where Etting became a favorite for the musical shorts that were then in vogue. But the marriage was volatile, and when Snyder found Etting was having an affair with pianist Myrl Alderman, Snyder shot him. Alderman survived and Etting wasted little time in divorcing Snyder and marrying Alderman, but the scandal was so shocking that it effectively ended her career. She died, largely forgotten, 1978.<br /><br />As you might expect, LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME plays fast and loose with the facts, presenting Etting as an innocent (she wasn't) and Snyder as a major crime figure (he wasn't); even so, it does seem to capture something elemental about both the era and the characters. Much of this is due to the on-screen chemistry between leads Doris Day and Jimmy Cagney, who spark and sizzle in a truly surprising way.<br /><br />It will not surprise viewers that Cagney plays Snyder extremely well; he is, after all, best recalled for his numerous crime-drama roles. But it may surprise viewers that Day had the acting chops to match him. Today she is most widely remembered as a master of light comedy, but in truth Doris Day's films of the 1940s and 1950s were more often hard drama than fly-weight amusements, including such heavy-hitters as YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN, STORM WARNING, and YOUNG AT HEART; she would continue her string of dramatic roles in such films as Alfred Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. Her performance in LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME is often considered her high-water mark as a dramatic actress: she gives it everything she's got, and the sparks really fly when she and Cagney square off.<br /><br />The look of the film, which was directed by Charles Vidor and sports art direction by the legendary Cedrick Gibbons, is beautiful, and the film moves at a smart clip; its one failing is that censorship issues of the era left several scenes--including a legendary rape sequence--on the cutting room floor. The music, drawn from Etting's most famous recordings, is also memorable, and Day pulls out all the stops for her songs. The DVD is not flawless, but you'll never notice it, and it includes several bonuses, two of which show us the real Ruth Etting. Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer",unsup
10021_0,"As I write this, TCM has a Ruth Etting 1930's short film playing (Think of short music 1930's films as the grand daddy of music videos). (Singer Ruth Etting and her small time gangster husband/promoter Marty Snyder were real life people. This film is said to be a partly fictional view of their marriage and breakup.)<br /><br />Doris Day plays Ruth Etting well. She's a bit beat up by life (and Snyder) and in the end, she's left him for a kinder man, but she squares accounts with him (for past promo work that made her a star) and sings in his club to large crowds. Tho Cagney is accused of attempted murder, you still feel sorry for him, and glad that Day will sing to promote his new night club. It seems modern that she has risen past his abusive ways to stand on her own, to forgive him and even help him in a manner that will not seem like charity.<br /><br />As Snyder himself says of his ex-wife's performance in his club ""She's fulfilling a contractual obligation...Business is business.""<br /><br />But here's where Hollywood (and maybe better 1950's recording technology) does better than real life. <br /><br />Day ***outsings*** Etting!<br /><br />Day sing the title song ""Love Me or Leave Me"" and ""Ten Cents a Dance"" and it still sounds modern today. Etting's 1930's recordings in early movie sound technology are tinny and too full of vibrato for modern tastes. <br /><br />If you doubt that Doris Day could play deeper dramatic roles, this film (along with films like ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"") should convince you otherwise...(We already know to expect a great performance from Cagney.)",unsup
10022_0,"I enjoy this movie, this is what good entertainment is all about, Hollywood today should learn lessons from movies like this.<br /><br />Well, as all of us classic movie fans know that the 1950's was the era of movies about real-life vocalists who rose to fame but had a hard price to pay that ruined them. Lillian Roth's story ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" portrayed by Susan Hayward, The Helen Morgan Story, The Country Girl, then ""A Star Is Born,"" and countless of other fictional or non-fictional films on vocalists who pay the ultimate price for fame. We never get enough of seeing movies about fallen stars who left a place in our hearts.<br /><br />This particular movie always interested me, I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies and fell in love with the singing of Doris Day, I didn't know there was a real Ruth Etting, I didn't know she was really portraying a real life singer, I didn't check out the real Ruth Etting until 2 years ago, I saw her for the first time in ""Hips Hips Hooray"" on Turner Classic Movies and was kind of shocked the real Ruth wasn't anything like how Doris Day portrayed her. Doris Day's portrayed Ruth as a sexy and sassy performer and sung with a strong, jazzy, bluesy voice, when I saw the real Ruth perform in the movies and in 2 shorts, she wasn't sexy and sassy, she was reserved, the type of performer to stand still and sing with great emotion and feeling, she wasn't the wiggling hips type like Doris Day portrayed and Ruth's voice was so light, airy, powerful without being loud and aggressive, you don't hear the blues, jazz in Ruth's voice yet she was a torch singer. I see why she was popular she was a one of a kind. She didn't have to shout and sing various notes to get a song across, she knew how to put over a number without all that fancy stuff, singers today could learn a lot about singing from Helen Morgan, Lillian Roth and Ruth Etting, they didn't have to jump around, move around, shake their butts, be overly blatantly sexual, they weren't loud and annoying to make you cover your ears, they just sung their songs, each word with feeling, they didn't do all that oooh, ahhh, ooohwoooyeah stuff. The two things that Ruth and Doris did have in common was they both sing with great feeling and emotion.<br /><br />The real Ruth Etting seems frail and too sweet, she's adorable, which makes me wonder why she hooked up with a gangster anyway but then again looks can be deceiving, I heard she wasn't the sweet, girl next door type in the first place and she wasn't so naive and a pushover like Doris Day portrayed her. Doris is very curvy and plump in this movie, she looks tough and looks like she could let the limping Cagney have it and run so he couldn't catch her yet Doris portrays Ruth as weak, so it makes me wonder what the real Ruth Etting was really like, the real Ruth looks so frail and innocent, she looks as though you could knock her over with a feather but I hear she was tougher than Doris portrayed her but I guess the movie was more interesting portrayed Ruth as naive and gullible. You know how Hollywood is, they never tell the whole truth, they either leave something out and put in what they want. Ruth Etting didn't like this movie, she said many things were false and she was going to sue but told not to by Walter Winchell. Ruth Etting was one of the top singers in her prime, the definition of a torch singer. She was quite unique and powerful yet with a little voice and a little body but you believed everything she singed, her adorable face and presence would naturally make you feel her pain, behind the pretty face that was a lot of hurt that was obvious through her singing. She was a true artist who makes you stop and listen.",unsup
10023_0,"Love Me Or Leave Me (1955) is perhaps Doris Day's finest hour as an all around performer. That she is in fair voice is to be expected. But to also find her an accomplished actress of the melodrama is quite astonishing, since Day is often known as the fluffy powder puff of feather weight musical tripe, or, the squeaky clean, yet strangely asexual appendage of Rock Hudson. However, in 'Love Me Or Leave Me' Day smolders sensuality, proving that her acting chops were sadly underrated during the rest of her career.<br /><br />The film is a musical bio based on the rather sorted life and times of torch singer, Ruth Etting (Day). Ruth's initial affiliation with Marty 'the gimp' Snyder (James Cagney) elevates her status from taxi dancer to nightclub performer. But Marty's a small time operator; a hood in the vein Cagney well understood and brought memorably to the screen in countless performances throughout his illustrious career. At first proud of his wife's success, Marty's admiration quickly turns to jealousy as he begins to sense a growing affection between Ruth and her piano player, Johnny Alderman (Cameron Mitchell). That the affection is platonic is a moot point, especially after Marty decides to put a couple of slugs in what he perceives to be his wife's illicit paramour.<br /><br />Apart from its tempered moral attitude toward sex, director, Charles Vidor keeps the film's narrative pretty darn close to the truth of Etting's own life. It helps, by classical Hollywood standards that in real life Ruth Etting achieved something of reconciliation with her murderous ex while dashing off into the sunset with Johnny. The score for the film is first rate. Day warbles to sultry perfection the smoky ""Ten Cents A Dance"" and ""Love Me Or Leave Me"", tears your heart out with ""Never Look Back"" and ""I'll Never Stop Loving You"" and stops the show with her radio debut, ""Sam, the Accordion Man"" and the film's singular, lavishly staged, production number, ""Shakin' The Blues Away."" Considered a departure from the 'usual' musical fair of its day, in that the emphasis here almost seems to be more concentrated on the drama rather than the music, 'Love Me Or Leave Me' is dynamic box office entertainment. It sings, slinks and sets the screen on fire with two enigmatic performances from Doris Day and James Cagney.<br /><br />Warner's DVD has been very nicely rendered. Though some grain and age related artifacts are apparent during transitional dissolves and fades (as was an inherent flaw of all early Cinemascope films), the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a more than pleasing quality with deep blacks, velvety navy blues and pronounced reds and oranges. Flesh tones can appear a tad pasty at times, but this is in keeping with the limitations of early Ansco Color and is NOT a flaw of DVD mastering. The audio has been remastered to 5.1 and is surprisingly aggressive during the musical sequences. Three vintage shorts, two featuring the real Ruth Etting, are the only extras we get. It would have been nice to have Ms. Day do an audio commentary, but alas, no such indulgence for the film buff.",unsup
10024_0,"This film reminds me more of ""Star 80"" than ""A Star Is Born"". I do not have any idea how close Doris Day and James Cagney came, in their portrayals, to the real characters. However, their performances are wonderful. I was especially taken with Ms. Day's portrayal. When she sings a song, she stays exactly in character she sings the songs precisely how her character would sing the songs. Cagney's performance is less remarkable than Day's, because he had less road to travel. He is certainly fun to watch, though! Granted, I don't know Ruth Etting as a performer; however, I do know Day is portraying someone quite unlike her standard screen persona. Cagney's portrayal depends more on our, as viewers, knowledge of a gangster's past (particularly Cagney's gangster characters). It would have been interesting to explore more about how Day's character is (or, is not?) attracted to this type of man.<br /><br />The songs do not intrude on the drama. Instead, the Etting songs punctuate and enhance different ""chapters"" in the film. A dramatic musical is somewhat more complicated than a musical comedy. This film succeeds as a musical drama.<br /><br />The flaw is that the film did not tell enough. There is a hint of a sexual attack of Etting by Snyder, which is followed by the wedding of the Day/Cagney characters. Her drinking, and his sordid back story, are as not as well developed as they should have been. These things make the characters less heroic, but more interesting and vulnerable. I think subtlety is great; we don't need to see everything, but ""Love Me or Leave Me"" should have unturned a few more stones. I do not need to see every piece of a puzzle, but need to see enough pieces for a full picture. <br /><br />******** Love Me or Leave Me (5/26/55) Charles Vidor ~ Doris Day, James Cagney, Cameron Mitchell",unsup
10025_0,"LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME was MGM's lush and richly entertaining biography of 1920's torch singer Ruth Etting. Though not big on the facts, it is a wonderfully compelling drama with music chronicling the rise of the troubled young torch singer, who, according to this film's screenplay, had a trouble getting her career going until she met a gangster named Jimmy ""The Gimp"" Snyder (James Cagney), whose dangerous exterior melted in Etting's presence escalating to his Svengali-like grip on her career and her personal life. Etting tries to retain her independence until it is implied that Jimmy rapes her and Etting becomes,in Jimmy's mind, his possession. It is the relationship between the two, slightly complicated by the warm-hearted pianist (Cameron Mitchell)that makes up the crux of the story here. Cagney has rarely been more electrifying on screen and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor but Day matches him scene for scene, in what is easily the finest performance of her career,but for some reason,the Academy overlooked her. Day, who was loaned to MGM from Warners for this, is smoldering, intense, and sexier than she has even been on screen. The scene where she stands alone on a nightclub stage, in a tight, black dress, dripping in sequins and fringe,and belts out the classic ""Ten Cents a Dance"" is worth the price of admission alone. If you're looking for facts about Ruth Etting's life, read a book, but if you're looking for supreme entertainment, don't miss this one. A must for Day and Cagney fans.",unsup
10026_0,"Doris Day portrays singing great Ruth Etting in ""Love Me or Leave Me,"" a 1955 film costarring James Cagney and Cameron Mitchell. The film tells the story, somewhat fictionalized, of Etting's rise to fame in the 1920s and her association and marriage to Marty ""The Gimp"" Snyder, a Chicago gangster. In the story, Etting is highly ambitious, and Marty helps her career after picking her up in a dance hall and realizing he's not going to get anywhere. He's hoping for the big prize - i.e., Ruth - at the end of the rainbow, but though she's grateful, she's never going to be THAT grateful. Finally, he becomes so angry that he rapes her (this is suggested in the film but the scene was cut by the censors). She marries him, though she's in love with a pianist, Marty Alderman.<br /><br />This film was made about five years before Ross Hunter glamorized Doris and made her the #1 box office star in a series of comedies, three of which were with Rock Hudson. Before that, she was a pretty woman with a sweet, smooth voice and sturdy acting ability. And nowhere does she demonstrate all three qualities as she does here. And throw in a sensational figure in some stunning gowns to boot. Doris' Ruth is a young woman who looks and acts like sugar but has the determination of steel underneath. She speaks softly but has the glint of ambition in her eye. Day's voice and style are nothing like Etting's, but the producers and director weren't looking for an imitation. Doris looks and sounds fantastic, singing a huge amount of music, including ""Ten Cents a Dance,"" the title song, ""Chasing the Blues Away"" and many others.<br /><br />Cagney gives an extremely powerful performance as Marty, a pushy little man with a huge insecurity and a passion for Ruth. It is a fully fleshed out portrayal of an abusive, possessive man that you can hate and pity at the same time. Cagney deservedly won an Oscar nomination for the role of Marty. He and Doris' contrasting acting styles mesh beautifully as well.<br /><br />Though there were liberties taken with the Etting story, if you read her bio, it sounds just like the film. Did the movie have a '20s and the '30s feel to it? Not really. But it doesn't matter. The film is in color and has a rich look, and what a score. What actors. A must see.",unsup

When you think of the films he made- White Heat, Yankee Doodle Dandy, Man of a Thousand Faces, and Love Me or Leave Me - I mean, who can compare? Joe Pesci is in some respects a good successor- as a little tough guy. But Cagney is great in all kinds of films- not just gangster films. And he could dance.",unsup

Anyone who questions Day's acting abilities should take a look at this film. Personally, I've always thought she was one of Hollywood's few singers who really could act. Look at the lackluster acting of Kathryn Grayson or Jane Powell sometime. Doris Day runs circles around them. If you're still in doubt after seeing this film, watch ""Julie"" sometime. Another one of her best films. <br /><br />Also, Day is in fine voice in this film. All of the songs are wonderful. ""Ten Cents A Dance"" and ""Shaking The Blues Away"" among the best.

One wonders if he had a parent that was abusive or an Uncle or someone he had intimately observed. Because from somewhere that man understood something about an abusive relationship and put it in his performance. It was positively beyond extraordinary. He deserved an Academy Nomination at the very least. While he was cruel, vile, despicable, certainly repulsive and yet you felt at the same time he was pitiful, sad, pathetic. It was an extremely complex performance. When I saw ""Love Me Or Leave Me"" as a teenager I didn't appreciate the subtlety of his acting.

I don't understand why in hell did people like Edwin Neal, Tom Savini, Brinke Stevens, Felissa Rose, Linnea Quigley, Robert Z'Dar and Joe Estevez even appear in this movie. Edwin Neal plays God. Tom Savini plays Jesus Crist. Robert Z'Dar appears for only 5 mins, and even makes fun of his own cult movie The Maniac Cop !<br /><br />The effects are cheap, and unrealistic. Awful soundtrack. The directing is even worse. Zombie make-up is none-existent. Some zombies are kickboxers, and kung-fu fighters. The acting is beyond bad. In the beginning of the movie, director Uwe Boll tells us not to watch this movie, because its bad. Well after seeing Zombiegeddon i'll have to admit, he was right. His House of the Dead was better than this. <br /><br />So, to sum it up - don't watch this movie. Its really that bad. And believe me, i've seen bad movies. This one is worse than Zombie Lake, Flesheaters, Bloodeaters, Meat Market, Redneck Zombies, Bone Sickness...etc. All of the B-movie stars listed above appear for only a couple of minutes each.

I can only concede it's a very fine music/drama/biopic. <br /><br />What's so unique about this film is it's skillfully combining the ""gangster"" element with the ""musical"" genre. The bio-based storyline plays out like somewhat like a crime drama, while the musical portion rings forth with twelve complete full-bodied numbers.<br /><br />The casting is truly inspired: what a coup getting Doris Day, at the peak of her physical, acting and vocal powers to be cast in a real-life role, while snaring the brilliant, often breathtaking James Cagney--forever at the peak of his powers--as the indestructible ""Gimp."" <br /><br />Together they create fireworks, playing off one another's sweet 'n' sour characterizations with great relish. How amusing it is to see Cagney having fun with his deft limp-walk and grueling thug-character, complemented by Day's equally enjoyable, contrastingly lovable persona. <br /><br />The songs are all very beautiful, and expertly rendered by Day in this, a wonderful tribute to her vocal talent and impressive musicianship.<br /><br />The script is well-written to utilize the stars' individual gifts, and the widescreen production is a delight to watch.

10031_0,"Before she became America's top box-office star by playing its oldest virgin, Doris Day was an instinctive, if untutored, actress and an accomplished, popular singer. In Charles Vidor's Love Me Or Leave Me, she takes on the part of Ruth Etting, the troubled songstress from the jazz age, and her twin talents merge memorably. It's a faultless performance, all the more impressive for staying understated, scaled down. <br /><br />Her co-star, James Cagney, takes the low road; as Marty (`The Gimp') Snyder, a lopsided fireplug of a man, he sizzles with resentment and ignites into rages. Strangely, his scenery-chewing complements Day's underplaying; the tension between their temperaments fuels this dark drama which occasionally resembles a musical but is closer at heart to film noir (Vidor, after all, directed Gilda).<br /><br />A taxi-dancer in a Chicago dive, Day catches Cagney's eye (he holds the linen-laundering concession for the place). Finding she's not the quick pick-up he had in mind, he lands her a job in the kick-line at another nitery he services. When he finds out she wants to be a singer, he arranges for lessons with pianist Cameron Mitchell (who plays the thankless role of the loyal but shoved-aside lover). But Cagney, used to getting what he wants and to browbeating everybody around him into surrender, meets his match in Day. Her quiet determination proves every bit as strong as his bellowing bluster. When it looks like her star is in ascendancy, he becomes her manager, puts her on radio, and snares her a spot in New York as a headliner in the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />They settle into a grudge-match of a marriage, with guerrilla warfare erupting from both sides. (Cagney's Snyder is a marginally less disturbed version of his Cody Jarrett in White Heat.) One of their flashfire fights takes place in her dressing room after a show. Cagney knocks a vase of flowers across the room; Day extends her arm for him to unclasp a bracelet. They bicker some more, with Cagney losing the argument while Day nurses the drink that has become her ally. He leans over and tells her `You oughtta lay off that stuff  you're getting to look like an old bag.' It's the chilliest moment in the movie.<br /><br />In the last third, Day answers a call from Hollywood, which lays the foundation for the unravelling of this messy, nerve-wracking relationship. And if the wrapping up grasps toward the sentimental (with a detour into the melodramatic), it doesn't quite take. Cagney, actor and character, hangs on like a bulldog with a bone. The Marty Snyders never change, and Cagney knows it; he stays the self-deluded small-time hood he started out as, who can't accept that he's driven away a woman he can't believe he loves so much.<br /><br />Day, however, rises to a magnanimity that rings hollow. Her steely self-confidence about where her talents would bring her, and her casual callousness in using Cagney to help her get there, make her final gesture improbable. But when she takes the spotlight, singing `Mean to Me' or `Ten Cents A Dance' (with her feet planted provocatively  defiantly  apart), Day, actress and character, takes it by natural right. The voice isn't quite right  Etting's was reedy and tremulous, Day's big and secure  but the assurance and style are dead on.",unsup
10032_0,"""Death Becomes Her"" is an exceptional look at dark comedy done right. Dark comedy is one of the trickiest genres in movies today because if not done right, you have an extremely uneven film on your hands.<br /><br />""Death Becomes Her"" is about aging in Hollywood which, according to Meryl Streep, is ""illegal."" ""Death Becomes Her"" is a fresh, original and satirical look at a classic and clichéd formula: growing old and the secret to eternal youth with a spin: it's effects on image-obsessed Hollywood. The strongest elements of this movie are the lively score, the award-winning special effects, and the highly enjoyable performances by Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis.<br /><br />""Death Becomes Her"" was Meryl Streep's first attempt at (dark) comedy and she outdoes even herself (""She-Devil"") with an energetic, brassy, loud, and devilishly good performance reminiscent to a blonde Velma Kelly (Chicago)...who's afraid to get older. Streep makes playing Madeline, a woman more concerned with getting older than her pathetic life, look effortless. Goldie Hawn plays her arch-nemesis, Helen and she commands the role with class and humor. Hawn gets the most out of this role and keeps you interested and charmed at the same time. Bruce Willis is surprisingly very good at playing Ernest, the man caught between these two women, and we get to see him in a role out of the ordinary in which he departs from action star to emotional weakling. The way he inhabits the role is so natural and polished it adds to the movie and makes sense of other two leads who are fighting over him. <br /><br />The actors play off of each other and even though the script is lacking (and gives these characters very little to work with), it's these inspired performances that carry ""Death"".<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is that in the end you have no one to root for, no one to care about, which is the script's fault entirely. The script falls flat but picks itself up, thus building momentum; falling from consistency to inconsistency, which helps keep the interest and helps keep the story alive, but it develops too many problems too late into the film. Finally, when there's about a half hour left everything begins to build up again and the momentum keeps building at you're awaiting a ""Bang!"" ending, when, ironically, the ending turns out to be anti-climatic. In the end, the script is just too campy and Robert Zemeckis can't save the film.<br /><br />In ""Death"" there are some similarities to other Robert Zemeckis movies but ""Death"" doesn't live up to his other creations. It's a movie entirely in it's own category and requires you to overlook the faults and get lost in the spirited performances. ""Death Becomes Her"" cleverly and hilariously deals with some of our greatest concerns; death, hatred, insanity, beauty, immortality, and, gasp, growing older!<br /><br />Performances: A+<br /><br />Script: C+<br /><br />Special Effects: A<br /><br />Score: B+<br /><br />Overall Movie: B",unsup
10033_0,The immense talent of Meryl Streep and some amazing body special effects are not enough to save this movie of being totally idiotic and a huge bore. The story is stupidly told even for a fantastic comedy and lacks a lot of real imagination. The gags shown along the movie are not funny at all. The final scene is so silly that almost makes you cry with despair. We can only regret that Miss Streep's talent is wasted in such a crap movie. But in fact this story of living dead could have been much better filmed in the hands of more talented director than Robert Zemeckis of whom I can't remember having seen any good movie till now.,unsup
10034_0,"From Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), this is a fantastic black fantasy comedy with great stars and story. Basically Madeline Ashton (Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) finds Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini, you see her great arse and cleavage) who has a potion to make her younger, stop ageing, and avoid death. When she gets home, her man Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) has plans to kill her and be with Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn). But obviously the potion rescues Madeline from a broken neck, and she is still walking, with her head twisted backwards. Soon after, Helen also takes the potion, and avoids a large gun shot in her stomach. Towards the end, Ernest can't handle being with either of them, and after they co-operate, and Ernest finally dies (naturally), it ends with them finally falling apart, but Madeline still gets a good final line. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Very good!",unsup
10035_0,"Wow--this is one strange and inspired comedy that is so unlike any other I can think of! Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play aging childhood friends who grow to absolutely hate each other. Both are shallow and vain and both feel 100% in the right for hating the other. The awfulness of their relationship culminates in Meryl stealing away Goldie's husband--just because she COULD! Years pass and Meryl is a fabulously wealthy actress--who STILL down deep is vain and self-centered. Back comes the previously fat and unattractive Goldie but instead, she is thin and looks even younger than she looked decades ago! It looks as if she went to the greatest plastic surgeons in the world and said ""here's a million bucks--gimme the works!!"". Goldie is back to rub in her good looks and also to steal back wayward hubby Bruce Willis--not because she even wants him but because she CAN! Well, Meryl is worried about losing her man but she's much more upset because Goldie looks so much better than her! So worried that she goes to a strange witch-like lady (Isabella Rosselini) who tells her she has a magic substance that can give her eternal youth!! Despite the cost, the vain lady gladly pays and drinks the formula--and immediately feels the wonderful effects.<br /><br />When she arrives at home, there is Goldie and Bruce to finish their plan--which is to kill Meryl and leave! Well, here is where the movie and special effects get REALLY, REALLY weird. Meryl is shoved down the steps and obviously breaks her neck. Goldie and Bruce are celebrating as Meryl wakes up and is alive--but, her head is on completely backwards!! After a little adjustment, she's back to how she was and the formula was an apparent success! So then she attacks Goldie with a shotgun--blowing her across the room into a fountain. A few moments later, Goldie gets up and walks about with a huge hole in her body--so big you can see right through her!! It's now obvious that she, too, has used the formula! Well, after some more senseless punching and slapping, the fight is over--they really can't kill the other no matter how hard they try. Plus, for some inexplicable reason, they decide to bury the hatchet and become friends again. Now, their immediate goal is to use Bruce's expertise as a plastic surgeon to make them look better--spackling in the hole in Goldie and being ready in case they needed touching up! Bruce has had enough and they try to force his to take the formula and be their permanent fixer-upper! But, despite their efforts and those of the weird little group with the potions, he escapes and vows to never see them again nor use the formula.<br /><br />At this point, the film is wrapping up and the film ends with one of the funniest and visually impressive endings in film history. Instead of elaborating, you just need to see it for yourself.<br /><br />The film has terrific over-the-top performances by Goldie and Meryl and Bruce plays an appropriately creeped out guy who just wants to be left alone!! The script is fresh and funny and provides a lot of amazing laughs. On top of everything, the biggest star are the special effects--amazing and so important to the movie.",unsup
10036_0,"I wonder if Zemeckis was attempting to preach to us about tampering with nature or for that matter, your outer body. Perhaps he was warning Hollywood about the danger in beauty plastic surgery that is getting out of hand. Maybe we should just blame the script writers for being very unfunny. The only advantage in watching this on broadcast TV is that the commercials were more interesting. But I liked the end party scene with Elvis and James Dean.",unsup
10037_0,"I know it didn't bring anything good to me. As a Christian I especially look for morality in a movie, anywhere I can find it, as long as there is some I might just enjoy the movie.<br /><br />But where the heck is the morality in this movie ? probably in the fact that one woman just wants to have her man back and the other one wants to look ""Forever Young"". It felt rather light to me, just as Hollywood often does, put a bit of morals in it and mix it with a lot of useless action, basic character building, ambiguous events and there you have it. This one barely makes the exception, it has Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as leads and that's pretty much the reason I watched it to begin with.<br /><br />But then comes the 'women's fight for man' except here one woman is just looking for 'immortality' (as many have put it) and that is basically the only part in which it differs from other movies. True this one was made in 1992 so it may deserve some of the credit but nonetheless it isn't gripping at all.<br /><br />I stopped watching after hearing the Lord's name being spoken three times in vain, how much do you have to go through before you say 'enough is enough' ?<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie, even though Bruce Willis does good acting it does not save the movie, at all. I advise you to look for something else.<br /><br />God bless you all.",unsup

10039_0,"This was one of my favorite movies the first time I saw it. After seeing 'What Lies Beneath', I would have to say that, as much as I love Back to the Future, I like Zemeckis' darker films best. I absolutely loved Bruce Willis in this movie.<br /><br />Also, the use of film manipulation and special effects is excellent for its' time in this movie, and is still easily appreciated even now. What I love best about Zemeckis, has to be his use of the passing of time in his movies. Huge time lines are crammed into a few chapters! It's amazing. Characters age. It's so great. And, as always, there is just the right amount of imagination in this film. One of his best!",unsup

That should be all you need to know.<br /><br />I love horror ...just so you know. I love a lot of really bad horror, but this is not the good kind of bad in any way.

They concoct an<br /><br />elaborate plot to push her car off Mulholland Drive, but Willis ends<br /><br />up pushing her down the stairs instead. After the deed is done he<br /><br />phones Goldie Hawn and breathlessly exclaims, ""Helen? I did it!<br /><br />She's dead, she started shouting at me and I couldn't take it any<br /><br />more and I pushed her down the stairs and she's dead!"" There is<br /><br />a long pause on the other end of the phone, then Hawn slowly<br /><br />asks , "". . . which part of the plan didn't you understand?"".<br /><br />Meanwhile, Streep is not dead, but is slowly standing up at the foot<br /><br />of the stairs with her head on backwards!<br /><br />Isabella Rosselini is good as the mysterious Lisle von Rhuman<br /><br />and, at times, looks and sounds uncannily like her mother, Ingrid<br /><br />Bergman. The film is not everyone's cup of tea, I know, but it's a scream!",unsup
10041_0,"In some ways, Goldie Hawn would seem like the only cast member who should be involved with the zany ""Death Becomes Her"", given that Meryl Streep is best known for serious roles and Bruce Willis is best known for action movies (not to mention that director Robert Zemeckis is best known for the likes of ""Forrest Gump""). But believe you me, everyone does a great job! Portraying two women vying for a man - and going to literally any length to succeed - this is one movie sure to blow your mind. Of course, the best part is what happens to Hawn and Streep. How anyone came up with that I'll never figure out! And then they fight! Ha! Overall, this is just a really cool flick. Whether we interpret it as a jab at Hollywood (and movie stars' obsessions with their looks) or as plain old wacky fun, it's still something else. Also starring are Isabella Rosselini as the woman who gives people the potion, and Sydney Pollack as a physician who gets a really, REALLY big surprise.<br /><br />I guess that you could say that Meryl Streep's character was ""neck-in-neck"" with certain other parties, and that Goldie Hawn's character had a hole in more places than her head!",unsup
10042_0,"The genre of black comedy is today unfortunately lacking in many aspects . To think of black comedies there aren't really many to begin with. Not many worth watching, that is. Other forms of comedy have in recent years gone to the extremes in such a way that the real element of fun is missing in all the sex and secretions. There are of course important comedic factors to make the audiences laugh but in my opinion they have to come from the characters and the writing.<br /><br />In Death Becomes Her Robert Zemeckis brings in a cast extraordinaire to a film that is fresh in ideas and verging on poetic in its writing. The way the film is sculpted leaves only the most essential scenes on the screen, which at the end resonate with each other and become vital like peaces in a thrilling yet dark puzzle. If ever death truly became her, Zemeckis has found the right wardrobe yet. The cast bring their unpeccable goods despite all the visual effects (which still after 14 years look amazing). It must have been difficult to form characters in such an environment but there they are - flesh and not so warm blood. The actors are not TRYING to be funny, they are. Meryl Streep is on fire, never missing a beat as the distraught Madeline Ashton. Goldie Hawn matches her magic scene for scene, and gives a real performance of desperation. Bruce Willis stretches his comedic muscles like never before or after this. Isabella Rosselini is brilliantly cast as the sour and joie de vivre Lisle Von Rhoman. One feels almost ashamed when watching her.<br /><br />What is even still surprising in Death Becomes Her is that there are real motives behind all the actions. Hurting the one you love by using beauty and youth as a weapon, trying to stay young forever, finding happiness - these are big things, and there might have been a serious way to approach it. But then of course the essence of humor would be lost and I would be deprived of hands down one of the best comedies I have ever seen.",unsup

I mean, the fight scene where the 2 start fighting with shovels and Helen breaks off the metal end of Mad's and she throws it right through her. ""Yes! I mean No! Oh Damn!""

The effects in this film were uproariously funny and definitely Oscar worthy!

I always loved watching it, it had the most incredible effects and I thought it was so funny. I was such a deranged 7 year old I guess. But still to this day, I really enjoy watching Death Becomes Her. It has a very clever story, amazing effects and three great actors: Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. Who said dark comedies can't be good? Death Becomes her shows the true competitive side of women that scares most of the human race, how far we will go to be the hottest, the smartest, the kindest, etc. But also the whole essence of eternal youth, beauty and living forever, and Death Becomes Her handles the subject very well.<br /><br />Actress Madeline Ashton and writer Helen Sharp are longtime rivals. Helen's life falls apart when glamorous Madeline steals Helen's fiancé, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville, and marries him. Seven years later, Helen is now an obese, depressed woman, and is arrested and placed in a mental institution. Obsessed with getting revenge against Madeline, she struggles in the institution with healing. Madeline's career on Broadway ends, and 14 years later she is still struggling with her fading looks and bygone acting career. Ernest, now an alcoholic and miserable in his marriage, has been reduced to working as a high-end mortician. When Madeline and Helen meet again at Helen's book-signing party, Helen appears miraculously rejuvenated, thin, and youthful. Madeline is first dumbfounded then jealous. As part of Helen's plan, she plays both Madeline and Ernest, telling them each she has never blamed them for her ruined love life. Madeline resorts to the aid of the mysterious Lisle Von Rhoman, who claims she has discovered the secret of eternal youth. Madeline purchases the potion, drinks it, and is delighted to see her body visibly losing the signs of aging as she watches in a mirror, leaving her thin, firm, and young. Helen, meanwhile, seduces Ernest and reveals to him a detailed and foolproof plot to kill Madeline. Ernest kills Madeline, Madeline is still alive Madeline kills Helen Helen is still alive death has become them.<br /><br />The film is flawed no doubt, it should have developed the characters a bit more, we never really understood why Madeline and Helen were friends in the first place as it seems like they've always hated each other, they could have just explored the friendship a little further. As well as why we should care what is happening to these pretty horrible characters. But still this is one of those films that for some reason keeps me watching it every time it pops up on TV. I think it was a lot of fun and had some good laughs, especially the fight between Madeline and Helen, they discover that there's really no point to inflicting physical pain but keep going at it with each other.

10055_0,"If only Bette Davis and Joan Crawford could be alive today and see this! Two emasculating she-wolfs battling it out - they think - because they want one man, but really, it's all about ego and oneupmanship, and with two equally established actresses such as Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, both looking exceptionally beautiful in their mid-40s, DEATH BECOMES HER is a visual treat that throws back an unintentional but hilarious reference to the aforementioned divas who preceded them. Very tongue-in-cheek, and whoever saw (and read) the sustained repulsion Davis and Crawford sustained throughout their life, mirrored in WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? will not be lost on the background reference.<br /><br />A simple premise presides: Madeline Ashton (Streep), a fading B-movie actress, relegated to performing an awful musical based on SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, sets sight on renown surgeon Ernest Manville (Bruce Willis) whom Helen Sharp (Hawn) has taken to meet her as a test to prove he will still be hers after their meet. Needless to say, he drops his commitment to Helen, marries Madeline, and sends Helen into a spiraling self-destruct mode. Years later she becomes a bloated whale - a shell of her former self - living in total abandon, watching Madeline's movies obsessively, seething in hatred, until she is evicted from her apartment and has a brilliant idea while in a mental facility: she must eliminate Madeline.<br /><br />Madeline, on the other end, is no less happy. A total, absolute bitch, she has reduced Ernest to blubber. She hates the way she looks at 50 and the way young girls preen their perky looks. Both live in marital hell. An invite to attend Helen's book party (on beauty) has her howling in laughter - beauty tips from a disgusting fattie? Please! - but when she sees that Helen is now a svelte redhead, she balks - and their reunion is one of dripping, beautiful venom, the highlight of the entire movie. Distraught, she seeks the advice of a mysterious woman, Lisle von Rhuman whom she was referred to earlier, and she gives her what seems an innocent potion to drink which will restore her looks. Meanwhile, Helen is planning to have Ernest dispose of Madeline and rekindling their botched affair. When Madeline returns home, she gets into a heated argument with Ernest and he pushes her down the stairs. She is dead.<br /><br />Or is she? A marvelous setup that until this point in the story works, but one which later takes a left turn to be overcome by silly fight scenes and cartoonish special effects that recall Tim Burton circa 1987. The triangle of actors work absolutely perfectly here, Streep drips with venomous lines reminiscent of Elizabeth Taylor's overwhelming performance as Martha in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?; however, Hawn and Willis, while established as personalities more than actors of considerable range, fare better than Streep in that she is ""expected"" to play hers to perfection. Hawn on the other hand proves she's capable of very dark roles that suggest more than they give. Willis, stripped of his usual machismo, comes across as a broken man who throughout most of the film is emasculated but makes one crucial decision which saves him from an uncertain fate. Casting these three actors are cast against type works in this edgy comedy, and if anything, it's final act is its own weakness, as if the writers had somehow not known where to go with the inevitable, violent encounter between them but all in all, it's still very enjoyable.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis, though, makes one glaring mistake during one of the key scenes. When Streep rises from the ground, we see Willis in the foreground talking on the phone to Helen who wants to know if she is dead. We know she is not; the deep focus has established she is not. As she slowly makes her way to where Willis is, Zemeckis chooses to cut to Hawn for a brief second. Big mistake. We don't need to see her sitting in front of her shrine of hatred for Madeline - we know she hates her, it's quite clear - so he should have held that scene perfectly still, allowing us to see Streep get closer and closer to the forefront. That is suspense in itself: how will Willis react to seeing his wife shuffling her way to him. But the use of deep focus is something that has fallen out of vogue in film-making, as if they've lost the interest to really tell a visual story, and the quick cut to Hawn being the need to give her a moment's screen time.",unsup

As conversations or question of immortality arises, I found myself quoting or referencing the movie.<br /><br />Because the movie is so watchable after so many viewings, I think this is a classic movie. It is about two woman trying to steal a man and fighting over their differences and jealousy. These woman wants to pursue immortality while another man wants to choose mortality and live a full life. It is the question of superficiality and immortality that struck me deep. The other issue is the desire to find that fountain of youth at the same time. The issues are as old as time. How do you feel when someone comes to you and say ""You are old!"". That was one of the phrases when a young man complains to Meryl Streep. These are some of the things you will ponder.<br /><br />Bruce Willis really surprise me this one as he no longer plays the tough man image. While Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep play great opposite roles as the two jealous fighting women who fight over differences and yet have to live together inspite of it. Yes, I have people I really detest and must live with them. Therefore, a lot of issues in this movie really hits me deep.",unsup
10057_0,"I never saw ""Death Becomes Her"" when it first come out because of a review I had read somewhere. The review was dismissive and made a lot of sense, so I decided to give it a miss. What a terrible mistake! This is a movie I would love to see on a big screen. The script is so brilliantly clever. Disguised as a silly comedy there is a world of serious themes executed by a knowing cast. Meryl Streep in particular, playing convincingly an actress without talent. I remember the bad review criticized the writers for setting the story in a rainy, stormy Los Angeles when California was going through a drought. Imagine if a comedy about magic potions should worry about the accuracy of the weather. In fact the Los Angeles of ""Death Becomes Her"" feels more like Los Angelers than most realistic movies and it does it with nerve and wit. ""In 12 years in Los Angeles have you ever seen a neighbor?"" screams Meryl to his mousy Bruce. An absolute delight. Other hidden treasures are a cameo from Sidney Pollack and a very funny and very sexy ""76 years old"" Isabella Rossellini. A new cult classic and a total must.",unsup
10058_0,"Death becomes her has a really good idea: what would it be like to live forever, stay young and beautiful? I don´t consider this movie gives an answer to that, but it represents one over-exaggerated view - a particularly well-carried out view. Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep make an unique performance and fit perfectly to their roles. Interesting was also to see Bruce Willis in so different kind of movie I have used to see him. The plot was a little bit too easy to guess beforehand, but I didn´t mind. Just great!",unsup
10059_0,"I must have seen this film about 15 or so times now. I love the vain, shallow characters of Madeline and Helen who are the ultimate example of what might happen if you took the advice of our ""obsessed-with-perfection"" media to its illogical conclusion. Meryl and Goldie play their parts with unrestrained enthusiasm, pushing them to the limit to emphasise that these two who believe they are truly beautiful are, after all, just caricatures of perfection. <br /><br />Like Icarus, Mad and Hell take no advice and pursue the unattainable regardless of the cost. That they see every mountainous obstacle as a mere minor inconvenience helps reinforce the humour of the film. Bruce Willis is marvellous as Ernest, the unhappy mouse caught in the middle of their game; the voice of reason amid lunacy.<br /><br />The writing is witty and sometimes painfully sharp, emphasising in almost every scene that beauty does not equal happiness, and the closer you come to attaining an obsessively pursued physical perfection, the further you get from real happiness and fulfillment. Stylistically our attention is focused on this concept over and over again, with mirrors and reflections used very creatively throughout the film.<br /><br />We don't see a lot of clever satire these days, which is a pity.

His scene is not worth to mention and he isn't as cool here as we remember him from other movies.<br /><br />""Maniac Cop"" Robert Z'Dar appears almost at the end of the movie and he hasn't much to do in here. Julie Strain appeared also in the credits and you wait for her appearance than you recognize disappointed that they only dubbed her voice as one of the callers.<br /><br />Conrad Brooks, the young Cop from Ed Woods ""Plan 9 from outer Space"", appears also here but why??? A few famous B-movie legends can't even save this garbage.<br /><br />Joe Estevez seems to be the only actor who really enjoyed his work. His appearances are really funny. William Smith as Lord Zombie in his terrible costume with his terrible helmet looks like he would say: Oh my God, what am I doing here? When will I ever get a part in a real movie? Most of the scenes look like they were shot in 1 or 2 hours. Another funny thing is that the makers talk in the Making-Of about Kung-fu fighting Zombies, but what they are doing is Kickboxing. Hey, Guys, wake up! There is a difference between Kung-Fu and Kickboxing.<br /><br />This DVD includes also one of the worst and most boring Making-Ofs I've ever seen.

Buried somewhere between the special effects (extraordinary by the way) is one the wittiest satires to come out of Hollywood in many, many moons. Meryl Streep is sensational and Bruce Willis is, I swear, unrecognizable in the best possible way. The movie hits the highest moments when, for instance, Meryl asks Isabella Rossellini how much the magic potion costs and Isabella replays: ""Oh the sordid topic of coin"" sublime, exquisite, funny but with enormous regard for its audience. But when Bruce calls Goldie Hawn to explain the ""incident"" at home he goes through a TV style monologue that seems to belong to a sit-com and not to the elegant vulgarity of this three sad, magnificent wannabees. The dialog, for the most part, is the best in any American serious comedy since Billy Wilder. The structure of the script is flawless and inventive. The costumes are atrocious and certain scenes seem directed by a 3rd assistant. I don't know how to explain it. However, I have it, I own it and sometimes I put it on with my finger in the fast forward. What's good is so good that makes the whole thing really worth it.",unsup

If you loved the comic, DON'T watch the film. If you don't care about the comic and you want to watch 2 hours of easy jokes, this is your film.",unsup
10063_0,"The definite challenge for a film director is his second movie. Many have made a good or even flawed but interesting first feature, and then either showed how good can really be (i.e. Tarantino's Pulp Fiction) or how the hits of their hit'n'miss first effort were just coincidential (i.e. Amenábar's Open Your Eyes). To me, Javier Fesser's Mortadelo y Filemón classifies him as somebody just gifted to be a garbage picker. His first movie The Miracle of P. Tinto was very irregular, it had some great moments (like the opening B&W short) and also tons of unfunny and lame jokes and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. However, the visual aspect of the film, while too tributary of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, made me think Fesser would ever make something of interest.<br /><br />Of course, I was totally wrong. Mortadelo y Filemón was a source material choice that was as commercially safe (given the fame of the comic books, EVERYBODY in Spain would watch it) as artistically risky (not only the comic books are really difficult to adapt to the screen, but everbody has his own vision of what Mortadelo & Filemón should be). Anyway, even an interesting failure would be nice to watch.<br /><br />What Fesser did was the worst comic book adaptation this side of Schumacher's Batman and Robin.<br /><br />OK, I see, Benito Pocino and Pepe Viyuela are reasonable M & F lookalikes (specially Pocino, whose heartwarmingly fun performance is the only good thing in the film), but I'd rather see Affleck and Damon play M & F than endure the debacle that's Fesser's film. And the rest of the cast isn't that good either: The Super is too thin, Bacterio is too fat, and everybody has too much hair. But I wouldn't mind if the performances were adequate. For example, in the comic books, Filemón is a more serious person with very bad luck (he receives all the physical damage that's destined to Mortadelo). In the movie, Filemón is just a permanently angry freak, and is not comprensible why he's the ""boss"". Also Rompetechos is now a ""facha"" (Francisco Franco-supporting nostalgic), which in the comic books never was.<br /><br />And the script... Ohhh, the gawd-awful script! I have read a Fesser interview where he said he didn't enjoy the first live-action Astérix movie because no matter how good the lookalikes were, it didn't respect the essential of the comics. Given this isn't it strange that in M & F the lookalikes are much better but the essence of the books is way less respected? Not only Fesser did the same thing than the producers of Astérix (another very bad movie, BTW), which was taking little bits of this and that story and glueing them without much coherence, but Fesser's film makes much less sense. It only resembles the comics in the visuals (which, by the way, still borrows a whole lot from Jeunet), but the plot takes the characters and gives them a 360 degrees rotation (if, in the comics, Ofelia ever kissed Mortadelo, instead of feeling pleased his reaction would be more like puking). Want more badness? It's incredibly boring and incongruous. Want EVEN more badness? Most of the characters, specially the non-comics-based characters Fredy Mazas (Dominique Pinon! Wasn't the Jeunet link already clear enough?), Nadiusko and the Franco-based bad guy Tyrant, have A LOT MORE screen time than M & F themselves. This seems more like ""Fredy Mazas' Big Adventure with cameos of Mortadelo and Filemón"". And, you guessed it, Fesser is more interested in his obsessions about Catholic Mass songs, butane gas cylinders and spoofing Spielberg movies than in making anything remotely connected to the works of Francisco Ibáñez.<br /><br />This said, and as the 1994 TV cartoon sucked as well (but by different reasons), the only worthwhile M & F screen adaptations are those made in the late 60s and early 70s (El Armario del Tiempo, and the likes).<br /><br />2 out of 10. Avoid like the plague, specially if you are a fan of the comics.",unsup

I hope you enjoy it as well and it brings a smile to your face and makes your day happy.

When the movie ended we both agreed we had to watch it again to be able to get the million things that happened at the same time on the screen. Just like in the comic books.<br /><br />To me, the highlights of this movie are, and not in this exact order, the cast and the script. I thought it was impossible to find someone to play Mortadelo that really looked like Mortadelo, or that Berta Ojea could make such a great Ofelia.<br /><br />The movie is so weird and so surrealistic that I don't think everybody would like it.

10068_0,"Mortadelo & Filemon's first film (and may be not the last because it's going to be a success) is just great. Transforming the comic into a movie was a really hard job, but Javier Fesser has accomplished it very well; the comic's gags, humour and constant violence is here, helped by convincing and hilarious special effects (there are many!); it's a mix between Fesser's humour (shown in El Milagro de P. Tinto) and Francisco Ibáñez one.<br /><br />The comics are quite known, specially around Europe, and of course, in Spain. However, whether you know them or not, it doesn't matter because its fun for everyone, all ages! The movie isn't based in any of the comics, but takes several elements from their first long comic, El Sulfato Atomico (1968), but there are many other references. Benito Pocino and Pepe Viyuela are excellent in their parts; Pocino doesn't perform. He IS Mortadelo. And he does his job fairly well. Viyuela isn't as similar as the comic's Filemon but has the exact psycology, and I think he does the best performance in the film. The other supporting actors, like Janfri Topera (as Prof. Bacterio) and Mariano Venacio (as the Superintendent), are almost identic, and you do really believe that it's the comic translated to the screen. Dominique Pinon plays Fredy Mazas, an invented character, hilariously.<br /><br />There are other funny characters like Rompetechos and the people in 13 Rue del Percebe, that have great cameos in this film. It is, as Francisco Ibáñez (the creator of the comic) said, the comic as a movie. It's really imaginative, with many original ideas and things (like Prof. Bacterio's cool inventions)<br /><br />Finally, must say that the special effects are simply amazing, and really believale (they don't look cheesy or fake), the best in spanish movies, and there are so many details that it's impossible to see them all if you see it only once; there are lots of gags and funny details that you won't notice at first sight, so look sharp!<br /><br />Very entertaining movie, you laugh your pants off ***1/2 of ****",unsup

1006_0,"Okay, I feel I must praise those who have given this film the bad rap it deserves! For starters, I remember getting invited to a special screening for, lets say, six bucks or so. I was expecting to see a wretched pile of bull, but I got something worse than that! I was so sure that having a few union actors such as Savini would give a little depth, or something enjoyable. NOPE! This film was the most pathetic concoction ever put onto film. Loust script, horrid acting, lame effects, and a whole lot of unreal violence that was just stupid to begin with. John Waters' ""Pink Flamingos"" looks like an early Spielberg classic in comparison, and thats a bad thing. I never had a problem with the Waters exercise in 'poor taste', because there was a message about it, this film, was just stupid. I cannot be more specific than that. Just stupid.<br /><br />Now, it began out with an extremely unbelievable sex scene with Tom Savini and Brinke Stevens. Stevens then retreats to her radio office to conduct a question and answering about zombies. We then see the worst acting of a man and his son hunting zombies, and a tiger is involved...er something. Anyway, a community is under attack with a bunch of idiots running around getting killed one by one. The lead cops are sick and sleazy, and achieve sexual kicks by forcing young males to make love. It is just stupid I tell you! They don't give a crap about civilians. I can understand a filmmakers need to be self-expressive, but there are limits to which art become ridiculous and repetitive. The rest of the story has a lot of bad acting, cheap vomit effects, dreadful dialog, and the STUPIDEST climax to be seen by anyone, be it whoever. My finale plea, is that the filmmakers of this movie need to be banned from writing, directing, or any other type of process in the industry. I thought I was going to see some film that would at least be on its way to a real film-festival...alas, this film was NOTHING! My advice would be to make sure NO ONE ever see's this film again.

I also have to say that things that look normal in the comics, may seem nonsense in the film, that's another component that I liked. As I said before, there might be people who don't like it because it has the humor of ""Torrente"", but the film is exceptional, especially because of the visual effects.

There was of course, a young couple in danger. I recall dark sets, with much of the action in a dark room, or maybe it was even a cave. As I mentioned, it's been a long time.

10072_0,"I have a feeling that many of us have entertained the whimsical notion, as we dragged ourselves to work in the morning, that it might be nice to have hot coffee fed intravenously into our systems. Well, in the misleadingly titled Boris Karloff vehicle ""The Man With Nine Lives"" (1940), we get to see that such a procedure might be as pleasant as imagined. In this picture, experimental patients of one Dr. Mason, who's looking to cure cancer victims via cryogenics, are brought out of deep freeze in just that manner! Dr. Mason and his nurse fiancée soon discover the body of cryogenics pioneer Dr. Leon Kravaal, 100 feet underground in a Canadian ice cave, where he'd been laying frozen--a corpsicle--for a full decade. Dr. Kravaal (played by Karloff, of course, in still another of his overly ardent scientist roles) is remarkably brought back to life, and begins his scientific pursuits anew. Anyway, this film is a fairly restrained affair, impeccably acted by its small cast, economically written, nicely photographed, and captured here on a pristine-looking DVD. The goateed Kravaal, likable at first, grows increasingly deranged as the film progresses, but still manages to hold the audience's sympathies; a brilliant scientist using unethical methods to achieve great ends. Despite the far-fetched central conceit of the possibility of freezing a man indefinitely and bringing him back to life, the movie is fairly believable; a testament to its intelligent script and fine players. But wait...did I say ""far-fetched""? I have a feeling that Walt Disney, Ted Williams and thousands of frozen sperm cells the world over might disagree with that sentiment!",unsup
10073_0,"The Columbia Karloff Pictures would recycle generally the same idea, incorporating touches here or there to remove identical ties to each other. Thematically, Karloff portrays a dedicated scientist whose goal is to benefit mankind through some type of medical experiment to prolong life. His work is treated with skepticism, unbelief, and scorn by local authorities and medical doctors who would find his experiments too fantastic to accept despite all his efforts to persuade him otherwise. The use of human guinea pigs(..voluntary, as often was the case)would not be received well by those who were critical of his work, or found his experiments too far-fetched or, as often was the case, morally objectionable. But, as in many of these film's story arcs, Karloff's scientists would proclaim that in order to achieve breakthroughs in science, sacrifice had to be made, most of the time those volunteers perhaps would've survived while under his care if those who oppose this new, ""dangerous"" science hadn't of interfered. The opposition would balk that the threat of human life was too great and so this dilemma always seems to disrupt Karloff, plague his desires to bring good to the world, not evil. <br /><br />The Man With Nine Lives establishes the experiment as ""frozen therapy"", cryogenic science as a method for benefiting mankind, with Karloff's Dr. Leon Kravaal, found in a chamber frozen in ice in his abandoned secret laboratory by Dr. Tim Mason(Roger Pryor) and his nurse/fiancé Judith(Jo Ann Sayers)as they were hoping to uncover notes of his research since he's known as the father of this type of growing medical practice many consider the future for helping the sick and dying. When it's discovered that there are four others in another room of the chamber where he was found, their lives are thrown into a crisis..those who threatened to imprison Kravaal for his frozen therapy, endangering a patient he had under cryogenic sleep, are awakened and despite the obvious success before them threaten to ruin all the potential benefits which could reach the world. See, when threatening to arrest him, Kravaal concocted a solution which could poison them if the liquid were to erupt into gaseous form, when breathed could cause harm. Instead, this solution, as written down while preparing it, stabilized those who ingested it, and so, for ten years, those in the ice chamber rooms remained in a cryogenic state, but kept alive. Unfortunately, Kravaal's nemesis is a greedy nephew who wants the inheritance of his patient in cryogenic sleep, and this maggot rips up and burns the exact written details of the solution which would in fact help prolong human life. This causes Kravaal to shoot him in the back, with others a witness to the murder..seeing as they pose a threat to his developing another solution, in the name of science, he will do whatever it takes to achieve again what has been lost thanks to the vile stupidity of another.<br /><br />In these kinds of movies, it never ends well for Karloff's scientists. He often achieves extraordinary results, paying the ultimate price, a sacrifice is often made so that others may benefit. In most of these films, Karloff would succumb to his human frailties such as revenge against those who opposed him or caused damage to the potentiality of success in his work. Unlike the mad science of Frankenstein, these Karloff Columbia Pictures grounded their stories in a modern setting, despite how outrageous the experiments might seem, often they still offer a realism, debating how far one should go to increase life expectancy. Those that find his work crazy, most of these films show that Karloff, at first anyway, was completely sane and determined to help his fellow man if allowed to continue his work unabated, and this was so often not the case.<br /><br />In most of these movies(..like Before I Hang or The Man They Could Not Hang)Karloff is provided a loving daughter who can reason with him in his moments of emotional blackness and despair, even as he threatens the lives of others who have railroaded his mission to bring medical breakthroughs to humankind. The Man With Nine Lives almost entirely takes place within the cramped confines of Kravaal's laboratory, holding prisoner those who were to arrest him, using them as guinea pigs for his experiments concerning the development of a new solution, needing to test his theories, raising the ire of his contemporaries, Tim and Judith, who can see the lengths he's willing to go to achieve success. Again, the story will seem familiar if you have watched other movies Karloff made for Columbia Pictures..if you like them, I think you might like this one as well.",unsup
10074_0,"""Scandal Sheet"" director Nick Grinde's ""The Man with Nine Lives"" qualifies as a good Boris Karloff mad scientist movie about the application of cryogenics as a cure for cancer. No, this is neither a scary movie nor is Boris buried beneath layers of make-up, though he does affect spectacles and a beard. Grinde and scenarists Karl Brownwho wrote ""The Man They Could Not Hang"" and ""Counterfeit Lady"" Harold Shumate explore the thin line between scientific genius and criminal insanity in this provocative thriller. The depth of sophistication in the writing and Karloff's extraordinary performancehe waxes from a kind gentle soul to a demented madmansets ""The Man with Nine Lives"" apart from most horror movies. Later, in 1940, Karloff played a similar role as a scientist with greater sympathy in director William Nigh's ""The Ape"" where he resorts to horrible means to perfect a serum so that a wheel-chair bound beauty can stand up and walk again. Moreover, ""The Man with Nine Lives"" deals with something much more believable, the use of cryogenics to eliminate human ailments. Indeed, this low-budget opus considers the difference between scientific success and its real-life application. Just because an individual is right doesn't mean that they are morally justified to perform their deeds. For example, the protagonist, Dr. Tim Mason (Roger Pryor of ""Belle of the Nineties""), impresses to the press how the use of cryogenics can help mankind before his procedure has been checked by others and the head of the hospital reprimands him for behaving in a presumptuous manner and advises him to take a sabbatical until his experiments can be checked.<br /><br />Mason and his fiancée Nurse Judith Blair (Jo Anne Sayers of ""Young Dr. Kildare"") use the leave of absence to track down the scientist, Dr. Leon Kravaal (Boris Karloff) whose research inspired Mason. Kravaal has been missing since 1930 and Mason resolves to find him. Kravaal lived on an island and a man who rents out boats warns them that several gentlemen visited Kravaal, but they never returned. Mason and Judith land on the island and find a destitute, empty house. The house, however, conceals many hiding places and they discover a dilapidated laboratory and Judith shrieks when they stumble upon a skeleton. Later, our heroes uncover a locked down and open it to find it filled with ice and the body of Dr. Kravaal. They revive him and Mason explains his interest in cryogenics.<br /><br />Dr. Kravaal explains how he came to be frozen. The circumstances involved a dying wealthy man who sought treatment for his ailment, but the man's hysterical son believes that Kravaal is taking advantage of a terminal case to make money and the authorities force Kravaal to take him to his island so that they can see what he has done. A medical authority who accompanies them has nothing but contempt for Kravaal's treatment of freezing a man to cure him. Kravaal gets the drop on them and smashes a chemical potion that knocks them out. Their interference brings about the death of the dying rich man and Kravaal stashes them in one of his frozen chambers. Unfortunately, the same chemicals that he resorted to so that he could take them hostage works on him and he collapses and is frozen until Mason and Judith thaw him out. They thaw out the incredulous authorities and the adventure really begins! This is a really thoughtful science fiction movie.",unsup

10076_0,"It's not exactly a major shock that Boris Karloff plays a mad scientist in this film, though it is very unusual the way he plays this role. Instead of the evil twisted genius set on making monsters or ruling the world, Karloff's goals are incredibly noble. And, when he later kills, you really understand with and could possibly condone why he did this. The moral implications of the film are astounding! As for the rest of the film, the writing for this sort of B-movie is very good, the acting fine and production values work out well (proving you don't need a huge budget to make a good film). About the only negatives at all are the ending (I would have just ended the film a minute or two earlier without the unnecessary final scene) and a mistake in the film about how deep the lab was under the earth. In the beginning, they count 191 steps to the bottom of the shaft to the lab, but later, it's just a homemade ladder about 12 feet long. Regardless, it didn't harm the film in any serious way and the film is a very good 'mad scientist' flick that actually is good entertainment and well thought-out.",unsup
10077_0,"This little known gem from 1940 is impressive for a few reasons: first, it stands head and shoulders above most of the B movies of the era, largely due to a good script and a great performance from Boris Karloff. Also, while made in the midst of the Universal horror period, it demonstrates some of the best elements of that genre, however it also pre-figures the oncoming decade of sci-fi flicks of the 50s, but with a more intelligent, and mysterious, plot than most of the B sci-fi films that followed. It also incorporates some noir elements such as shadowy images, gun play, etc. The Man with Nine Lives is also known under the alternative title Behind the Door (which is actually more accurate).",unsup
10078_0,"A doctor researching ""frozen therapy"" seeks out Boris Karloff, the therapy's originator. Boris has been missing from his island laboratory for ten years. After ignoring requests to stay off the island by locals, the doctor and his beautiful nurse discover Boris frozen in secret caves beneath the lab. Boris has been frozen along with a host of villagers. Through flashback it is learned these others came to arrest Boris for murder ten years earlier and they all wound up being gassed and frozen. This is the proof Karloff needs to vindicate his research. He sets out to duplicate his accidental results, his methods become increasingly Machiavellian. Ultimately he is his own undoing. This movie is hard to catagorize. The film makers tried to add shock to an interesting scifi story. The film succeeds in spite of the efforts to punch it up. The acting is uneven but overall this is a top notch ""B"" effort. The science is very plausible, a rarity in old laboratory films. See it and be pleasantly surprised",unsup
10079_0,"Rome: Total War is a great strategy game. The Total War series is one of the best around, only Football Manager can beat it. The game is set during the growth of the Roman Empire and the mission is simple: take control of the empire! There are 3 factions that trying to gain power, the Julii in the North of Italy, the Brutii in the South and the Scripii in Central Italy and Silicy. You are meant to help gain territory for the Empire until you have enough strength to conquer Rome itself and the other two factions. As you conquer states you are also able to play as other states such as Gaul, Greece, Egypt, etc. What makes the Total War types of game in one. There is the battle real time part which is excellent and the mission is simple, win! The other part is the turn-style strategy on the European map and you have to do a lot to maintain your empire. There are other parts to the game as well, such as Historical battles and set-piece battles.<br /><br />Rome: Total War is a great game and worth playing and is very addictive.

10080_0,"I bought Rome Total War (short: RTW) because I was interested in the add-on Barbarian Invasions. The add-on promised to invoke the mood of the final days of the empire and the early middle ages, the period that is the subject of Gibbons book, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. This period holds my special interest because I am fascinated in last days and falls of anything. However I never got around to buying the add-on since I was disappointed in the way Rome Total War worked on a strategic level. Let's get around to RTW main failings before getting to the good bits. This way we can end in a happier mood. <br /><br />RTW's primary failings are on a strategic level. Politics, broken down into internal and external relations, are usually based on marriages, the key component in the power-games that surrounded the rise of the roman empire. However in RTW internal relations, while being represented in the game, are beyond the influence of the player. External relationships are better represented, but in RTW you can't arrange a marriage with representant of another nation and an alliance is as easily broken as it is agreed upon by the AI, which doesn't represent reality and for game purposes it means it is useless. In fact with the exception of bribing most instruments of the diplomat in this game are either not effective or useless.<br /><br />Strangely, while in politics there is not enough control, there is to much control on the economic level. You can develop every town in any way you see fit, while in reality and of necessity the ancient period lacked a tight centralized control. Only the roman emperors could, because of their vast wealth and power, slightly influence economics, but even when they applied drastic policies these would general fail or backfire.<br /><br />There are more strange things in this game. For instance, populous cities always get inflicted with rebellion regardless of how many guards or pacifying buildings you assign to them, so you need to exterminate the population of all large cities you conquer. This extreme measure seems to have no influence on the opinion of the rest of the world as far as I know. A bit strange. Another strange thing is that when you are roman, the senate will give you quests that half the time simply undo-able(conquer a city in the middle of enemy territory within 10 turns, even if the trip will take 10 turns). There are many more examples, but let's leave it with these two examples.<br /><br />Now after all this negativity, let's have a look at the positive sides. The best way to do it is to forget that the game tries to accurate depict historic realities of ancient roman times. If you look at the game from the bottom-up: that it is battle generator in which the battles are given a context by having a rudimentary, but easily manageable, strategic shell, the this game is superb. <br /><br />The battles are stunningly well done. There is a wide selection of troops available who's composition is dependent on the nation you play. Play the Greeks and you get a hoplite army, play the Parthians and you get a horse army, play the Romans and you get a heavy infantry army. Each nation is well represented with their own troop types which allows for much replay-ability and sheer enjoyment when watched on the battlefield. The AI in combat is adequate(compare it with the AI from Mark of Chaos, which is two years younger and performs worse) although it is unable to learn from failures, so once you find the key to defeat a specific army composition(horse archers vs infantry) then the AI will not adapt his army to the new challenge. The developers have put in every effort to make sure the battles are pleasant experience by easy control, speed of pace and free range of the camera. There is little to more to require. A special remark I want to make for the sounds. The developers have chosen good sounds in the battle and for each of the nations you can play. This is well done and enhances the mood of the game.<br /><br />So here is it, a weak strategic shell but a hell of a good battle generator. With these limitations it is recommended to anyone interested in tactical games. Hopefully the add-ons will be available in one big bundle in the near future.",unsup
10081_0,"This film is a 75 minute animated commercial for the Gobots toy line. The animation was produced by Hanna-Barbera, so I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Since I was nearly 30 years old when this toy line was introduced, I didn't expect to really understand the charactors, and the plotline.<br /><br />As I watched this epic, I kept wondering what made Roddy McDowell do a voice for this thing. Musta been paid major bucks.<br /><br />The bad guys are destroying everything in their paths, and the good guys (the GOBOTS®) are out to get them. Lots of pointless shooting, and noise. Perfect for the kids of the mid '80's.<br /><br />The color and animation is typical Hanna-Barbera. The backgrounds were decent, but the stilted animation style hurt the flow of the story. Perhaps Tonka (the toy maker) just couldn't see paying more for better work. If they had, this film would be better.<br /><br />Hanna-Barbera is not at fault here. They are capable of some fine work, and have done fine work in the past. This, unfortunately, is not the one.<br /><br />This film was rated G.

Not much different than the equally forgettable TV series, except with this they got ""celebrity"" voices. Hanna Barbera should never have been hired to make a robot cartoon. There was a reason Transformers is remembered and loved and Gobots gone and forgotten-- the difference in quality of their respective television shows. Both were good toys, but Transformers had fun stories and great animation (for its time). Gobots was standard Saturday Morning schlock. I strongly suggest get the DVDs of ""Machine Robo: Revenge of Cronos"" (currently out on Region 1) instead and see how the Gobots & Rock Lords should have been done.",unsup

I can't even begin to tell everyone how disappointing this movie was to me. Maybe it was because I was a preteen and I really didn't care or it could have been because I was getting into other things. <br /><br />If I had the chance to compare this movie to the Transformers movie I'd have said that the Transformers would have won hands down. The Transformers movie was nowhere near as violent as this movie was and even then at least the writers of the Transformers movie waited until somewhere near the middle before they even started killing off characters. In this movie we see a character being killed within the first five minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Needless to say if I had 1000 monkeys on 1000 computers they could come up with a better idea than this.,unsup

The part of the lava scene was unrealistic and they should have added more young go bots. Get rid of those weird rock creatures and put in some young guardians and renegades. They are girl go bots so I resume that they can reproduce since they have souls of men and brains. The only smart people in this entire movie were the girls, Soltaire, small foot and A.j.

She is eager to start their home life together. All he can think of is seeing his mother.<br /><br />Louise Closser Hale is superb as the suffocating matriarch of his family. The other members, including Henry Travers and Margaret Hamilton, are very good as well. Especially fine is John Beal, as Montgomery's nephew. Indeed, he gives a heart-wrenching performance. It's possibly the best in this movie and he is working against very stiff competition.<br /><br />Montgomery is not only a mama's boy -- called Vicky by everyone, as his name is Victor. He is also a supreme narcissist: In one shocking scene, he inspects himself in a mirror over the mantel. Directly under the mirror is a plaster bust of him that Hayes has lovingly worked on sculpting. He doesn't even notice it.<br /><br />It's very hard to fault this movie. The ending is a trifle disappointing. And a Mark Twain aphorism is spoken by one character and laughed at by others, as if it were original to this screenplay.<br /><br />Hayes is superb and very likable. Montgomery, not generally a favorite of mine, is believable as her self-centered husband. Beal is absolutely superb in a very touching role.

This movie thoughtfully updated elements of Stoker's conceptualization of the vampire without losing those classical elements that makes it an interesting tale. Acting is excellent and casting great.

The other scene I remember is that this vampire (who wasn't attractive at all and looked very much like a mid 40's accountant with a trench coat) made a much needed cash by selling the paintings of the women he murdered. In fact in the scene I remember there was this old lady who was a fan of his art, and the painting she was purchasing was of a nude girl lying in a rock with a knife stabbed in her chest.

10092_0,"It's been close to 30 years since I watched this movie with Richard Lynch as the blonde vampire, and who played the part to perfection. For the younger people expecting blood, gore and action, this isn't the one to watch. Vampire is more of a 'reader's' film, where the imagination fills in today's 'action' in movies. An earlier film I saw him in is called The Premonition, where he portrayed a rather creepy carny; also a fascinating film. I've been looking for this movie, Vampire, for all these years and would love to see it released on DVD. I'd wondered for years whatever became of Lynch and am glad to see he remained active for some time. I was surprised to read in his mini-biography that he'd been burnt in a drug related fire.

I read where his portrayal of the vampire Voytek is Richard Lynch's favorite role, and well it should be - he is marvelous!

It has brains, style and a surprisingly literate script for a change.

True, you have a ham of the grind house, Richard Lynch (good in ""Scarecrows""), but he is better here as the vampire than you'd expect. At least it was not Henry Silva! For more of this quality, see ""The Night Stalker"" (a true classic, Dan Curtis' ""Dracula"" with a fine Jack Palance, and Bob Clark's ""Death Dream"". Oh yes--- throw in Soprano's creator David Chase's strange drive in flick ""Grave of the Vampire"" for good measure (not nearly as good though).<br /><br />Sadly, the only as yet released version of this film is a 12 year old VHS tape put out at SLP speed to boot!

10097_0,"Seven Murders for Scotland Yard is pretty much your standard Giallo fare, and that is no bad thing! The plot revolves around a vicious psychopath who goes around brutally slaying prostitutes. You would expect a film with this sort of plot to be a completely brutal and sleazy affair, but Seven Murders for Scotland Yard is surprising in that aspect as while there are murders aplenty, there's no real nudity, and the murders themselves have been heavily edited, so we don't get to see much more than a bit of blood. This is unfortunate as Seven Murders for Scotland could have done with these appealing elements to compliment the plot, but even so; it has to be said that this isn't a bad film on the whole, and it's certainly one of the better Spanish Giallo's. As mentioned, the plot focuses on the murdering of prostitutes, and as the title suggests, Scotland Yard are soon on the case. The main suspects in the murders is a Peter Dockerman, whose girlfriend was killed along with the prostitutes, but Commissioner Henry Campbell of Scotland Yard doesn't believe Dockerman to be the one they're looking for.<br /><br />It's clear just looking at this film that it didn't benefit from a large budget, and indeed the locations do all look very cheap. Of course, the fact that my copy isn't exactly brilliant doesn't help, but it is obvious that director José Luis Madrid was merely cashing in on the popular formula of the day. Like a lot of seventies Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy. Naschy has given some good performances in the past; but this isn't one of his better ones. In fact, none of the performances in this film really inspire anything from the audience and it doesn't seem like anyone is really putting any effort in. The plot is fairly standard stuff too, though it never completely dries up as there's always another murder just around the corner. The identity of the murderer becomes obvious early on in the film, and the twist I was expecting never came. The ending itself is decent enough, however, as we finally get to see the killer's lair and the climatic struggle is decent despite the fact that you wont really care who comes out victorious. Overall, Seven Murders for Scotland Yard is a decent enough Giallo, but there are many, many better ones out there!",unsup

However, it turned out to be quite a mess: not so surprising when considering that the only other J.L. Madrid film I've watched was the similarly dispiriting THE HORRIBLE SEXY VAMPIRE (1970)!; as in that film, the women here are mainly on screen in order to disrobe and get butchered.<br /><br />The plot provides three possible suspects of the serial killings: a crippled and bitter ex-trapeze artist (Naschy) whose wife is among the victims, a handsome schoolteacher of noble birth but who's actually impotent and, surprisingly, a police commissioner who just happens to be the latter's boyhood chum and is also secretly in love with his wife (Orchidea De Santis, whom I saw in the flesh and on screen  in Luciano Salce's equally obscure but infinitely superior political satire, COUP D'ETAT [1969]  at the 61st Venice Film Festival)! <br /><br />The Swinging London locations are just about the only authentic element here: both the gore and the occasional action scene look extremely phony; another clear measure of the film's lack of budget is that Naschy's accident (which continues to haunt him) is hilariously depicted simply by having the actor throw himself in front of the camera and utter a couple of none-too-convincing groans!",unsup

It's a decent thriller with a mysterious Jack the Ripper wanna be who kills each victim with a distinctive blade, each from a different country. One by one, prostitutes are turning up dead and missing various body parts, a set of eyes here, a heart there. One of the early victims is Naschy's whore for hire wife, and he becomes a suspect in the early investigations, despite the fact that a younger, athletic man is the type sought, and Naschy has a gimpy leg from a high wire accident that ended his circus career. The local criminal element has it in for him as well, the murders bring the cops down on them and it's hurting business. The mystery of who the killer is and why he's so eager to carve up the local tarts is decent giallo fodder and satisfied me. Orchidea de Santis provides some hotness and Andres Resino ( the boyfriend in WEREWOLF SHADOW ) does OK as a friend of the cop running the investigation. The copy I watched is from VSoM and looks like a 3rd gen dub. It's in Italian with English subs that get the job done. Sadly, it's also the covered version of the film and not the nude version that was prepared for export. The film was dubbed into English had played the US in 1976, and this presumably was the uncovered variant, but it's whereabouts are unknown. A real shame as it's up there with a lot of the Italian giallos and without the nudity, it comes off as a bit tame considering it's subject matter. Here's hoping it turns up someday, it's on the list with a few others that really need their nude versions found so these films can be properly appreciated.

1009_0,"Based on a Broadway play, ANOTHER LANGUAGE is one of those gems from yesteryear that few have heard of. It has much to recommend it, chiefly: believable and detailed interaction among members of a rather large and unpleasant family, mostly given to self absorption but with moments of genuine compassion and caring that surface unexpectedly. One of the members of this family is Margaret Hamilton (who was in the Broadway original) in one of the few roles that allowed her to enact a somewhat complex human being. Louise Closser Hale is perfectly cast as the controlling, selfish mother who sets the tone for her whole brood. Helen Hayes, a supremely skilled actress who could play ordinary people and make them fascinating, wins the viewer over completely as the bride who runs afoul of her in-laws. I wanted to marry her myself! The standout, however, is young John Beal who delivers a passionate performance as Robert Montgomery's younger brother. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS*** His character is introduced well after the conflict between Hayes and the family is established. He is appalled that his family is treating Hayes so shabbily and falls madly, dangerously, recklessly in love with her. His vital, fresh-faced, youthful innocence and earnestness captivate the viewer. He too had played the same role in the stage version. This performance might have launched Beal to the top of the Hollywood firmament, but Hollywood didn't suit him, and he settled into a 60-year career of minor films, regional theater and numerous TV roles. Montgomery himself is top notch, as usual, playing the insensitive product of his narrow-minded mother's upbringing. Don't let the conventional opening scene as Hayes and Montgomery disembark from their honeymoon cruise fool you. It gets better fast. The theme is similar to that of HOLIDAY, based on a Philip Barry play, in which a free-spirited outsider clashes with members of his fiancée's stodgy, traditional banking family.

It's really got nothing to do with the film and it certainly doesn't make you say ""I need to watch this film."" <br /><br />The twists and turns this movie take will keep you on edge right to the last shot. I even loved the last scene so much it took this from an 8 to a 9 so stay tuned right until the end credits flash up.",unsup
10103_0,"I was really disappointed in this movie. Most thrillers will spend the first hour developing the characters, involving you in their story so when they are in danger you are frightened for them. You truly care for them and feel for what they go through. But not in this movie. Before the first hour is over, our heroine is already fighting for her life, and it would appear the story is about to come to an end. There was no real developing of a plot, and it made me think the writers were in the hall closet writing it as we watched. It feels rushed, and when we do meet the killer, we feel short changed.<br /><br />Candice Bergen should stick to comedy. She is not interesting in the role of victim, but comes across as bland, boring. I was actually rooting for the killer at times. There is way too much dialog at times and no one seems to know how to dial 911. It is not a movie I would recommend if you are looking for an on-the-edge-of-your-seat type thriller.",unsup

10105_0,"""The Criminal"" is a noirish Brit crime flick which tells of a man (Mackintosh) who is in the wrong place at the wrong time and finds himself as a murder suspect on the run from the police and a bunch of super secret underground heavies.

10109_0,"cinematography starts out excellent, actors talented but do not bother with this film. I love Eddie Izzard and Steven MacIntosh; all the other actors were excellent but this was a hateful script, which tortures viewers. We readily identify with MackIntosh's & Natasha Little's characters, so evil done to them is spikes driven into our eyeballs. Not since ""Clockwork Orange"" have I hated a film so intensely and I admit that Clockwork had redeeming values, art-wise & social commentary-wise. ""The Criminal"" was a lame excuse for someone who is de-sensitized to violence (whether by video games or limbic system dysfunction) to slam viewers' heads down onto a table. I put it on fast fwd after 20 minutes into the film and made stops to catch up with dialogue, skipping violence. Thus, for me, the film was thankfully 45 minutes long. Despised the ending. Let it be known that my favorite writer is Dostoyevsky. So I'm not a suburban granny making whiny comments. I can handle intensity/violence if the plot is worthwhile & characters get to develop (I have to hand it to MackIntosh, his work in this was, as usual, top notch). My favorite movies are ""Dr. Zhivago"" and ""Gangs of NY"" (and I recently appreciated ""In Bruges"") These films do not spare the viewers' sensibilities, with Cossaks slaughtering innocents and Bill Cutting's vengeful personality.

1010_0,"Anyone interested in family relationships will surely enjoy this movie about a manipulative matriarch, Louise Closser Hale, who is not averse to fake fainting spells to get her way with her four sons and their wives. The acting is first-rate by a stellar cast, five of whom (John Beal, Hal K. Dawson, Irene Cattell, Maidel Turner and Margaret Hamilton) were in the original Broadway production which opened 25 April 1932, and who reprised their roles. This was also the film debut of Beal, Hamilton and Cattell (the only film she ever made). But kudos go to the magnificent Helen Hayes as the new addition to the family who stands up to Hale, John Beal, as her sensitive nephew who falls in love with her, and Robert Montgomery playing Hayes' husband, still under the control of his mother. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Stick with it until the end; the last 20 minutes are as riveting as any drama can be.",unsup
10110_0,"The Criminal is undeniable proof of the adverse affect that Pulp Fiction has had on cinema. The title of the movie is actually ironic, as the movie itself is no better than a common criminal. After paying money to see it, you'll see why. Basically, The Criminal is a huge waste of 90 minutes. I can think of multiple better things to do in 90 minutes than watch this movie, one of them involving your own toenails and a pair of rusty pliers. After seeing the film, I doubt that you will disagree. It is with that in mind that I say; don't bother with this movie. The premise of The Criminal is actually quite intriguing, and you'll be forgiven for thinking that the film is worth watching for that reason. After the first ten minutes, you'll think that you've made the right choice in deciding to see the movie. You're wrong, but you won't know it yet. The movie opens with a man chatting to a woman in a bar. After hearing his speech about dance music being rubbish, you'll be utterly convinced that you're in the right film, but you're not. The man and woman, after some banter, go back to his apartment. Events transpire, and she ends up dead. Shock, horror! Indeed, as it's down, down, deeper and down from then on. And just to clarify; I don't mean 'down' as in 'down into Britain's criminal underworld', unfortunately.<br /><br />Steven Mackintosh takes the lead in this film. You'll almost certainly recognise this man from one of Britain's good crime films; Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The character that Steve plays here is, in fact, only a certain plant away from being the same character that he played in Lock, Stock; namely, a wimp who happens to be in a world of criminals. The rest of the cast isn't noteworthy, with the exception of the police inspector. He isn't noteworthy for anything but swearing a lot, however. He swears and he swears and then he swears some more. That's all he does, and it gets beyond a joke after the third or fourth swear word. It's a blatantly obvious attempt to cash in on the childish 'coolness' of profanity.<br /><br />Pulp Fiction's influence can be seen all too often through this film; but what The Criminal doesn't realize is that just because it worked for Pulp Fiction, doesn't mean it will work here. At times, the film works in flashback sequences that just pop up from nowhere, it sometimes uses cool dialogue to convey it's points, and sometimes puts stuff in just for the sake of having it there; and all in all, it's extremely annoying. That's all this film is really; annoying. Annoying, boring and unoriginal sums it up perfectly, and it is, with no fear of a lie, one of the worst movies of recent years. Maybe even of all time",unsup
10111_0,"I saw the Criminal on Palm Pictures VOD and i must say, while at first I was skeptical, I thought it was a fantastic movie that unwounded perfectly with many twists and turns along the way. Each scene gets better and better and the story only gets more confusing but in a way that works towards its advantage rather than the opposite. Once the movie ended, I was just stunned, in almost awe of the film I saw, for everything will come unraveling at the end and doing so in a fantastic way to boot.<br /><br />The acting I admit was a bit mediocre. The main character was decent, but his acting wasn't award worthy by any standard. The other cops do an okay job as well, with the male police officer being the best, but overall this won't win any awards for acting (note to director: the American girl was awful! She shouldn't be allowed to act ever again!). However, what really wins over is the plot. It does a good job revealing little hints throughout the movie e.g. Usual Suspects to provide the viewer with a grasp of what's going on. But viewer be warned, when you think you know it all, you'll be in for a real surprise. Believe me, i thought this movie was going to be a real cookie cutter noir film. It's much more than that, you just have to be patient with it.<br /><br />Is The Criminal the film of the decade? Probably not. But it's one hell of a ride. After thirty minutes in you'll be so immersed in the story you might forget all about the mediocre acting. With a great plot, intense action, and unbelievable suspense, The Criminal is one of those surprise films that should get recognized more in the states but probably won't. It's definitely more refreshing than the usual Michael Bay garbage we're used to here.",unsup

The beginning looks good, the musician picking up a gal, and then her getting murdered. But that's about it. From there on, it's a downhill slide of contrived complications, red herrings, swearing inspectors. The swearing in this film was something else again like the British are trying to prove that they can be as foul mouthed as Americans.<br /><br />I won't urge you to skip this. You might have reasons of your own to see it and if you do, all I can say is good luck.",unsup
10113_0,"'The Criminal' is an overlooked gem that I hadn't heard of prior to it showing up on cable. It captures classic noir in a modern framework with all the appropriate darkness and unsympathetic characters. The British have a knack for such crime drama, and I cringed throughout imagining what the Hollywood version would be like. (I'm surprised filming hasn't already begun.) The cast is brilliant from the top to the bottom of the credits, and the lead, Steven Mackintosh, is particularly outstanding as the trapped innocent attempting to piece together what he's fallen into. When it comes time to pull together the plot elements, writer/director Simpson makes a long stretch and comes up with something outrageous and a bit too easy, and some of the concluding twists feel somewhat contrived, but by this time, it really doesn't matter. The film's fast pace, great acting, and dark cinematography have already succeeded in making it a thoroughly entertaining noir.",unsup

It's by no means the worst film on the world, but it could have been so much better.<br /><br />There are some funny moments, and parts where you do wonder just what the hells going on. You can decide for yourself whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.<br /><br />I did enjoy the beginning, the way it kind of gave you a false sense of security; how it gave you the impression that the film might be something that was completely different from what it turned out to be. But it did go down hill from there on end.",unsup
10115_0,"The little-known and underrated Steven Mackintosh stars in this ambitious and complex British thriller which keeps you right on the edge of your seat until the end.<br /><br />Sadly, the end is a little bit disappointing but when you watch this endlessly twisting conspiracy story you'll soon come to realise that it is just too clever for its own good. And while that's not exactly a compliment, at least this low budget attempt at North by Northwest proves first-time writer/director Julian Simpson is not given to compromise.<br /><br />The story begins late at night in a Soho bar where unassuming thirtysomething musician Jasper (Mackintosh) is drinking alone until he's joined by stunning blonde, Sarah, played by Natasha Little. She seems very keen to go back to his place, crack open a bottle of vodka and spend the night doing whatever two broad-minded and drunk adults like to do. But at 2am there's a knock at the door and suddenly the pace of The Criminal picks up as Jasper gets a smack in the face and wakes up to find the blonde had been slashed to ribbons and he is the number one murder suspect.<br /><br />Up steps Bernard Hill as a hard-bitten copper who effs and blinds his way confidently through some fairly ropey dialogue. Unable to come up with substantive evidence, he lets Jasper back on the street (pursued by bumbling police, naturally) and our hero immediately begins to unravel the very murky story behind the murder. Be prepared to pay attention very closely from this point onwards because The Criminal is not a movie for those suffering post-MTV attention deficit disorder.<br /><br />Mackintosh, whose character probably seemed pretty flat on paper, is onscreen almost constantly and thankfully he's up to the job, rescuing what might otherwise be a celluloid disaster. You might not know his name, but if you've seen Lock Stock, Blue Juice or The Buddha of Suburbia, you'll know the face. There's a good role for Soldier Soldier star Holly Aird as Hill's sidekick but unwarranted top billing goes to stand-up comic Eddie Izzard, who pops up fairly unconvincingly for about ten minutes of screen time in a role that's perhaps a little too vital for someone so inexperienced. Comedy lovers should also watch out for Red Dwarf co-star Norman Lovett in a very brief cameo.<br /><br />Pick it apart and The Criminal doesn't hold much water. But despite its faults (of which there are a fair few) you are going to find it very hard to switch off without finding out what happens in the end.",unsup
10116_0,"Lightweight, predictable fare that's nothing to write home about, but a really enjoyable movie nonetheless that I gladly watch anytime it's on TCM.<br /><br />William Holden plays a recent widower who realizes his son needs a mother. He goes into town and ""buys"" a wife (Loretta Young), whom he treats with respect (he's a gentleman) but also quite aloofly (he's still deeply in love with his dearly departed wife and is not ready to move on). Predictably, the boy resents the presence of this new woman and isn't ready for her or anyone else to take his mother's place. (You just know the boy and Holden are gonna come around by the end of the flick and the three of them are gonna be one big happy family.) Add in charming, wandering, singing-and-guitar-playing rogue Robert Mitchum and you've got quite an enjoyable story. Mitchum appreciates Young and strikes up a friendship with her, which piques Holden's curiosity over this woman he's previously overlooked.<br /><br />Loretta Young is supposedly lovely in this film -- if you like her, that is. Personally, she's never caught my fancy and I've never understood her appeal, though I never let her presence in a movie keep me from watching it; that would be a shame and I'd miss some good flicks if I did! (OK, so ding this review if you're a LY fan and I dissed your lady, sorry! :) <br /><br />William Holden is ... well, um, drool, pant, sigh ... absolutely gorgeous in this movie. He is reason alone to watch it! Robert Mitchum isn't too bad either, and has a surprisingly nice singing voice (yes that's actually him doing all that singing).",unsup
10117_0,"I have a pet peeve and before I begin I want to say a few words about it. I have done a huge number of reviews and am constantly noticing that even the most mediocre films get scores of 10 from some reviewers. While this is definitely a better than average film, no sane person could say it deserves a score akin to that of GONE WITH THE WIND or THE GODFATHER. I think it's great to love a film, but over-scoring it doesn't lend much credence to your review. Just my two cents worth and I'm sure I'll catch heck for saying it.<br /><br />As for this movie, it's a nice little family film that benefits from being very unique and having several wonderful performances. In this slice of pioneer life film, William Holden and his son are left alone after the death of his wife. Needing a mother for the boy and someone to help out around their frontier homestead, he travels to the nearby fort to find a wife. There, he buys an indentured servant (Loretta Young) and brings her back home after marrying her. Not exactly a romance, I know! Unfortunately, there never really is any romance, as Holden and son treat her more like a hired hand and after a while it's obvious she resents this--especially after she works herself to the bone caring for them. Into this very unhappy situation comes ""the stranger"" (Robert Mitchum)--who immediately realizes the problem and proposes to take Rachel away from this drudgery--and pay Holden for her! While there is a lot more to the film, this certainly made for an unusual flick.<br /><br />The performances all around are excellent and the film ended on a very good and not especially sappy note. Well worth your time and I have no serious complaints--other than the writer who indicated that Miss Young was playing a lady who was 25 (yeah, right!!). In actuality she was a decade older and she wasn't fooling anyone--but still a lovely woman regardless of the age difference.",unsup

It's a good 'family' movie, and I believe it would be popular.<br /><br />Considering it was one of RKO's biggest hits in the late 1940's, I guess the public back then saw it the same way I see it....as a terrific film.",unsup
10119_0,"This film plays out as a sort of western Rebecca (1940. Rachel (Lorreta Young) lives in the shadow of Big Davy's (William Holden)first wife when she is 'bought' to keep house and educate the young son. The film essentially follows Rachel's efforts to gain acceptance and prove herself a worthy acquisition.<br /><br />Young is good in her role, adequately conveying Rachel's disappointment with married life and her relationships with two men, Holden and Mitchum. Holden and Mitchum in a sense both occupy the stranger tag of the title. Young marries Holden as a stranger, and he remains a stranger even in marriage. Mitchum is the stranger who appears and seems to offer Rachel a chance at salvation. Both men suit their roles. Holden, at first a grief-stricken widower, cold and unwelcoming, begins to open up to Rachel and appreciate her as a wife and companion, not a slave. Mitchum sings and provides a lighter presence. Gary Gray gives strong support as the child who learns to love Rachel as a mother figure after his initial mistreatment of her.<br /><br />There are some interesting themes here, particularly the idea of female servitude. 'Rachel And The Stranger' poignantly questions the role of women in society and also the portrayal of women in western films. It looks at the gun myth in western films- guns allow Rachel to assert herself in a 'male' aspect. It hints at Rachel's dissatisfaction with the lack of sexual relations in her marriage. the Both central male figures are worth close analysis- Mitchum claims to love and appreciate Rachel more than Holden's character, yet he too only thinks of Rachel in monetary terms when he offers to 'buy' Rachel from Holden.<br /><br />'Rachel And The Stranger', in haunting black-and-white cinematography, is a real little gem of a film. It's simple, yet powerful themes and efficient running length mean that the film does not stray into long-winded sequences that detract from the original premise of Rachel's struggle as a 'replacement bride'.",unsup

I only say little because my mother and I are the only two fans of it that I actually know of, but I'm sure there are hundreds of fans out there who love ""Rachel and the Stranger"" as much as we do. TCM runs it two or three times a year and I try not to miss it. I guess it was a big hit in its time even though it's not as well known today, but my advice is to watch it if you ever get the chance. At about 90 minutes it doesn't wear out its welcome and seems to be over as fast as it began. And with three great stars like Loretta Young (WOW!), William Holden and Robert Mitchum, you really can't go wrong. All three are perfect in their roles. The film is a traditional Western in many ways, but what I like most about it is the humor that's woven in throughout. One sequence even develops into slapstick, but it works. Overall, a really wonderful and enjoyable movie. This is the kind of film that you just end up counting among your favorites even though it's likely that no one you know has ever seen it.

The unsophisticated characters conceal a complex film about family and gender, in which the usual Indian threat is more of a psychological displacement.",unsup
10125_0,"""Rachel and the Stranger"" is a pleasant film that combines two genres to great advantage. On the one hand, it has the feel of a western, but it is also a tender love story. Pictures like this one were made in the Hollywood of the post-war when all the men were back and happier times seemed just on the horizon. The film reflects the hope of those years as it gave its viewers a good time for the prize of admission.<br /><br />The story is simple enough. A lonely widower, David Harris, with a young son can't cope running their farm without the help of a woman. The solution is to go into the near settlement where no one knows his wife has died to try to get a woman that could come and help with the farm work. He has to resort to buy a servant woman, Rachel, for a ridiculous sum and heads back to his place. There is a best friend who takes only one look at Rachel to realize she's a diamond in the rough. Through Jim's interest in Racehl, David comes to realize what this woman is worth after she walks out on him and the farm. David will come to his senses and will realize he has loved Rachel all along.<br /><br />The film unites three stars in their own right: William Holden, Loretta Young and Robert Mitchum, something that would be prohibitive by today's salaries and egos. RKO scored big with the casting alone. Norman Foster directed with his own easy style. The three principals do an excellent job in creating characters that the viewer will like.<br /><br />""Rachel and the Stranger"" is a good way to spend an evening when there is nothing else to do.",unsup

10129_0,"At its most basic, ""Rachel and the Stranger"" is a domestic comedy set in the wilderness of 18th century Ohio. Director Norman Foster manages to pack more charm into each five minutes than most films have during their entire running length. <br /><br />At its most ambitious, ""Rachel and the Stranger"" is an allegorical story about the impact of a catalyst into a seemingly stable dynamic. In this case the stranger in the title, Jim (Robert Mitchum), visits the isolated farm of long-time friend David Harvey (William Holden), his young son Davey (Gary Gray), and their bond servant Rachel (Loretta Young). David bought Rachel (who is working off her late father's debts) after his wife died, needing a replacement to help raise Davey. He married her out of respect for social convention but has no intention of consummating the marriage. <br /><br />While David treats Rachel with respect and consideration, his son is openly resentful of the substitute mother. After some initial progress the threesome settles into a distanced existence, a rut from which there is little chance they will be able to escape on their own. But things quickly change when Jim stops by on his way to town. For the first time Rachel has someone who actively engages her. Jim's attentions build up Rachel's status in Davey's eyes while causing David to see her obvious attractions for the first time. But Foster doesn't limit things to this predictable interplay; he builds on it by having Rachel quickly come out of her guarded shell in response to Jim's interest. Even the makeup people get into the act as Young goes from the look of a plain pioneer woman to a subtle radiance.<br /><br />All four stars are excellent. It was probably Holden's best performance as he provides most of the humor with his growing attraction to Rachel and his increasing irritation with the attention Jim is paying to her. <br /><br />Young was about 10 years too old for her 25 year-old character but this is not really a factor as the age of the character is unimportant; you wonder why they did not simply change the one reference to her age after casting Young for the part. Young's acting tends to be underrated because of her later work as a television hostess but even her film work as a teenager was extraordinary. She was an especially good casting choice because the repressed Rachel needs to subtly convey a depth and dimensionality early in the film to make her later transformation plausible.<br /><br />Mitchum gives perhaps his liveliest performance as he seems to be having a lot of fun with his part. Gray is solid as always, one of those rare child actors who were not irritating after a few minutes on the screen.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",unsup

She was a year past her Oscar winning performance in The Farmer's Daughter and really at the top of her game. Rachel is a bondservant who is bought by widower William Holden to help out at the family farm, bring back a feminine touch to the place and help raise his son, Gary Gray.

Yes, the movie is rife with small flaws throughout. Sometimes they can be distracting (for example, you lose the illusion that a movie should create and instead you get the feeling that there are production people behind the camera) but still, the story and some of the characters depictions are so strong that you are still left with a haunting and depressing feeling long after the end credits.<br /><br />The best side of this movie is that it shows the life in those times to be as brutal and unappealing as it probably really was. It makes you think twice before you might think: I would like to have lived then!

Faced with his sexual desire, he flogs himself, while in the meantime he's trying to convince the skeptical Hurons to convert. They can't understand him and his strange views or why in his Christian heaven there is no sex or tobacco. In the end, it earns him their deep mistrust. On finding the lost mission, a miracle considering all the dangers involved, he converts the inhabitants of the village, only to have them all killed by the non-believing Iriquois.

1013_0,"I recorded this movie a few weeks ago from our local community television station Triangle's night broadcast. I was surprised to see this on their schedule, as it's usually the lowest rate affair. The situation was another example of a great work getting lost in another vast video copy collection.<br /><br />I was excited to be seeing an early movie from a director I always admired. I'd only ever seen his Hollywood work, and was especially fond of his Sci-Fi classics growing up. As others recognize, Verhoeven unashamedly puts into his films, his honest impression of the societal constructs we humans consistently find ourselves in. That regular criticism of the complexities of human nature, beyond the norms of each film's particular genre, has always resonated with my world view.<br /><br />I finally watched this film this morning. As it started it was obvious the image quality was very poor, not helped by early scenes being predominantly in the dark. Not surprisingly the character's voices were dubbed into English, but were often mismatched or exaggerated, unfitting for the film. It seems to be the UK version I saw, yet some accents were American. I always try to watch a film in it's original intended language, but it seems the foreign films on the local community station are only ever poorly dubbed video copies.<br /><br />Despite the poor quality of the copy I saw (the video company's logo even popped up irregularly in the bottom corner of the image), this film really amazed me. Much of the reasons why have been detailed by the few other comments on this site. The biggest flaw of the story for me was that the film ended too suddenly. This seems a common element to films the further back in cinema history you go. I actually appreciate a well crafted credits sequence, easing the viewer out of the film's world, and allowing reflection. Even at nearly 2 hours long, I felt my interest would have been sustained for a little bit longer.<br /><br />There is a DVD listed here with 5 of Verhoeven's films in their original Dutch form, with English subtitles. I'd like to see this one again, and the rest of his early creations, which others consider even better. Rutger Hauer is also a great, varied yet charismatic actor, and it seems his best work might be with Verhoeven.",unsup
10140_0,"The two things that are most striking about this film are its unqualified realism and the beauty of its wilderness photography.<br /><br />The story takes place in the 17th century in what was to be Canada; it concerns a Jesuit priest (Father Laforgue) from an upper class family in France who comes to Quebec City and is tasked with traveling through the wilderness some 1,500 miles west to work at the Huron Mission there. Laforgue is accompanied on his journey by a party of Algonquin Indians as well as by Daniel, a young French interpreter who is primarily just up for the adventure.<br /><br />As the journey proceeds and the seasons move from fall into a harsh winter the mood of the film becomes ever more bleak. The continuing culture clashes between the Algonqins and Laforgue are sometimes humorous but are ultimately sad in their revealing insights into how difficult it is for one culture to understand another. One scene has Laforgue transcribing a brief story told by the Algonquin chief and then having Daniel take the transcription some distance and read it back to another tribesman. Laforgue is trying to show the Indians that he has much to teach them, but their interpretation of the incident is that he must be some sort of demon. When the party meets up with some members of another tribe and they see Laforgue dressed in his black robe and ask if he is intelligent, the Algonquin chief quickly answers, ""No."" On the other hand Laforgue views the Indians in their current unenlightened state as savages.<br /><br />Not all is love and harmony between the various Indian tribes. When the Lafourgue party encounters a band of Iroquois there are some scenes of violence and torture where the squeamish may want to avert their eyes.<br /><br />Daniel, speaking the Algonquin language and having taken up with the chief's daughter, begins to have some understanding of the Indians and their ways. One interesting exchange between Daniel and Lagorgue is:<br /><br />Daniel: They believe that in the forest at night the dead can see.<br /><br />Laforgue: It's childish Daniel.<br /><br />Daniel: Is it harder to believe than in men of paradise where we all sit on clouds and look at God?<br /><br />Laforgue's most singular personal characteristic is his unwavering faith. His reaction to sexual temptation is confession of sin and self flogging. He sincerely believes that Christianity can bring salvation to the Indians, but the Indians have their own gods and view Laforgue with incomprehension. The film's success in making us understand both of these positions gives the ultimate conclusion a dimension of tragedy.",unsup

10142_0,"This is one of the most genuinely multicultural, or cross-cultural, works of film art I have ever seen. There are quite a few films of course that show another culture's point of view -- and no lack of films showing an idealized Indian point of view. But this one shows two very different cultures in early contact with each other -- and for the most part manages to show us each culture, Great Lakes Algonquin and Huron on the one hand, and French/European Canadian missionary colonizers on the other, from EACH OTHER's point of view.<br /><br />It is the most successful example of that I have ever seen.<br /><br />And it does all this within a serviceable plot. Not great, but serviceable -- and apparently true, so far as the basic outlines are concerned at least. As was said above, the early parts of the movie drag too much. The whole movie, in fact, is rather slow. But that tends to be the nature of these sorts of films. Their emphasis is on cultural understanding. It does a pretty amazing job of that. <br /><br />Unlike most films of this sort, the AmerIndians are NOT idealized. (As for instance they are pretty unreservedly in Dances with Wolves and Little Big Man.) The special and central brutality of some of their customs is amply demonstrated, especially towards the end. The Hurons are prepared to skin the rival chief they have captured literally alive, after killing and then burning alive his children one by one, essentially to make a political point. It does not look like an easy life, and I imagine far fewer people would leave this movie thinking they would have wanted to be Indians, or live among them, than feel that way after films such as Dances with Wolves. It was such a hard life.<br /><br />And yet many spiritual and wonderful things about the native culture come through without question. The centrality of dream visions in their spiritual world is given real power, and we can feel it. We can see how they see the French, and the supposed best of the French, the Black Robes. It is very much how one feels when one can understand two mutually exclusive belief systems. I suppose in a sense the point of view is closest to that of the young French companion and guide for the Priest. He falls in love with a beautiful and very young Indian chief's daughter, and tries to join their group -- and yet he also understands the priest, and is attracted to his spirituality. He sees both sides --- and so do we.<br /><br />It is an interesting movie for those who are historically or anthropologically interested. It is probably a bit slow if you are just looking for action in a colorful setting. It doesn't have the pace of Last of the Mohegans, for example. But that movie is mostly about settler and British military life on the Indian frontier -- but bridging understand of the native cultures they are in conflict with and among, to some extent, through the ""half breed"" hero. This one is mostly about Indian life at first contact with the Whites. Fascinating, if you like this sort of thing at all. I certainly do.",unsup
10143_0,"This movie is a must see.<br /><br />I would like to say that I enjoyed reading the excellent comments of others about this movie. I was just as moved by this movie as most of you. I would like join you in my praise for this movie.<br /><br />I was awe struck throughout this movie. Watching Black Robe, was like actually being there. It was as if I had heard about this place and these people but now I was transported in time. This may sound trivial but it is the best way to express my reaction. Througout the movie I strained to see every detail in every scene. I tried to catch every nuance. It seemed so real that I expected to smell the smoke, the water, roasted meat etc.<br /><br />The cinematagraphy was incredible. It is refreshing to see a movie that does not rely 100% on special effects for its 'cinematagraphy'. The scenes from altitude showing the line of canoes paddling through the vast wilderness were awesome. The sound track was powerful. The camera was able to create sensations of fear, abandonment, helplessness that were so vivid.<br /><br />The dialog was superbly realistic. Facial expressions were used more than words to convey thoughts. What little was said was in such simple short sentences that got to the point. It is just what I would expect from the no non-sense Indians interacting with an idealistic priest.<br /><br />I am not a history or anthropology expert but I feel that the movie was highly accurate. The director portrayed both cultures bias free (a rash statement to make). The director allowed the viewer to condemn or extol either culture. In the end I felt like the young Frenchman- I could see both cultures for what they were - not good and not bad but coping with the situation at hand.<br /><br />The importance of religion (both Christain and Indian) in everyday life is very well depicted. The Catholic religion is portrayed on equal footing with Indian religion. To White man and Indian alike, both appeared mystical beyond comprehension. The dilemma of which culture, which religion to choose was well depicted with the young Frenchman. However the same dilemma existed for the Indians. Everyone had to choose and each choice took them in a different direction. It seems that in order to survive it is best to be able to switch back and forth at will.<br /><br />I feel that the movie McCabe & Mrs. Miller in some ways addresses the same sort of issues. A California gold rush mining town advances toward 'civilization' when a whore house and a church arrive at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Black Robe.

What I love about this film (that I have watched over a dozen times and will watch many more times) is that it doesn't take a point-of-view regarding the European colonization of the New World and the native American culture. Both cultures are seen as slightly insane world-views that are, ironically, valid in their own way, yet futile at the end of the day. <br /><br />It concentrates on one Jesuit priest and his journey to the New World. The film demonstrates how difficult his journey was and his passionate commitment to his faith. But it also shows how nutty these priests were to try to preach to the unconverted. It also presents several native American tribes (such as the Hurons and Mohawks) and how truly savage they could be. <br /><br />This is one of the great films of recent (perhaps all) time.

Excellent performances, especially by the young man playing the Jesuit priest. This movie is very touching and is very successful at making you care about the characters. Finally, Black Robe is a good adventure movie, with graphic violence and brutality. All in all a tremendous movie that should not be missed.",unsup
10147_0,"Black Robe (1991) <br /><br />Released with poor timing in the aftermath of a similar themed film - Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves - Black Robe largely got lost in the shuffle. That's a shame, because the film is actually quite remarkable. Not to say that it hasn't had influence on other films however. Black Robe certainly must have had quite an influence on Terrence Malick and his The New World. The title credits are clearly inspired by those in Black Robe, and other aspects are familiar as well.<br /><br />Set in 17th century Quebec, the film follows a young Jesuit priest, Father Lafourgue (Bluteau), referred to as Black Robe by the natives. He travels with a band Algonquins lead by Chomina (Schellenberg). With Father Lafourgue is Daniel, a young Frenchman, who is in love with Chomina's daughter. The young priest soon begins to inspire fears that he is some sort of demon, and many in the band wish to leave him behind, or possibly even kill him and his companion.<br /><br />Their travels meet turmoil among other hostile native tribes, leading not only a struggle between peoples, but a struggle between faiths. Beresford creates a very bleak atmosphere, using the cold Quebec landscape as an intimidating, but still beautiful backdrop. The weather feels cold, the air crisp. It's really quite a beautiful film to look at.<br /><br />Bruce Moore, who wrote the screenplay and the novel it was based on, went to great lengths in research to accurately portray this period in time. Many have praised the film for its accuracies, while a number of others have however complained that it shows natives as savages. I have to disagree. Neither side is shown as total bad guys, nor total good guys. The film gives everyone a fair shake. Both sides have/had their reasons, and both sides committed terrible acts. Certainly, not all Natives were all about peace and love, which is not a slight to them in the least. Their history is a noble one, and they had every right to fear and be hostile in the face of Europeans. That said, I'm probably overcompensating for the film, because it really doesn't show Natives as savages at all, especially not the Algonquins. Moore claimed, in fact, that he actually toned down the violence of the Natives compared to what he found in his research. That said, what he found in his research was most likely overstated to begin with.<br /><br />Black Robe certainly is a bleak picture. The naturalistic photography and tone adds to the depressed atmosphere. This is not a story of joys, but of sorrows. When the film ends, we are told what history has already told us - the Natives were slaughtered and the Jesuit's mission by and large was a futile failure.<br /><br />Though the film sticks to its own dark history, this is more than just a very well done history lesson. Black Robe is a parable of the horrifying results that come from misunderstanding, miscommunication, and ignorance. While the Jesuit mission was well intentioned, it was more a product of Eurocentric ignorance than anything else. The Native people had their own religious beliefs, and the film shows that. The lessons in Black Robe are transferable to any number of modern day conflicts. We have not learned our lesson, and by removing the gloss and glamour off the period epics of old, Black Robe serves as a reminder. Such a shame its so overlooked.",unsup
10148_0,"Brian Moore grew up in Northern Ireland and considered joining the priesthood before he moved to Canada and abandoned his Catholic religion later in life. I've not read this nor any of his other novels, but I am told that on several occasions he explored the idea of a priest losing his faith, and I wonder if perhaps, in spite of his outward angst against the Irish clergy, he wasn't in fact (like so many ex-Christian writers) struggling to cast of his guilt and to justify abandoning his own vocation.<br /><br />In ""Black Robe,"" for which Moore wrote the script as well as the book, he has chosen not to inject overtly anti-clerical themes. Perhaps he preferred to let the times speak for themselves: the French clergy in North America did most certainly believe in their mission to convert the Natives to Christianity, and no one believed in any sort of philosophical or cultural relativism. To the modern, deracinated and denatured man, this is offensive in and of itself and there would be no need to add the demonising of clerics so ubiquitous to contemporary cinema.<br /><br />But to those who dare question the modern liberal conscience, this film is done accurately enough to sympathise with and appreciate the Jesuit's mission. The French are portrayed as sympathetic but imperfect: the clerics are naïve and occasionally condescending in their dealings with the Natives, but as we watch their efforts unfold Moore, whether he meant to or not, shows that they truly wanted and tried to understand and relate to these poor souls they ministered to.<br /><br />And to pray for the salvation of these ""poor, savage souls"" was hardly condescending, and not only from a Catholic standpoint. For the Natives, life was short, violent and fearsome; death was always around the corner. Their religious beliefs were tightly wound with their daily routine and way of life (as they are in all pre-""Enlightened"" societies, including those of Europe and European North America) and with life so tenebrous they feared anything innovative would completely destroy them. ""We have accepted the gifts of the French, and we have come to depend on them. That will be the end of us."" This is evident in Chomina's gradual coming to grips with Christianity and with the Abbé Laforgue (known to the Natives as ""Black Robe""), but his unwillingness to let go and accept Baptism even on his deathbed. The Huron sense that the transformative power of the Baptismal water is so profound that they will ""cease to be Huron,"" that their enemies, the Iroquois, will sense their weakness and destroy them.<br /><br />And yet, Moore has so successfully replicated the brutish world of the Native American that the viewer who can overcome modern Political Correctness will indeed find himself wishing not for their destruction but that they and their enemies could, in one sense, cease to be Huron, cease to be Iroquois, for their own sake and for each other's, before it is too late! And they, too, understand this: as Abbé Laforgue reminds his young companion, ""These people are gifted with intelligence."" It is significant that Abbé Laforgue himself is perceptive enough to realise that fact, even though their intelligence is one that he can never understand. The movie ends on an apparently hopeful note and then reveals--through text--something utterly depressing about the near future, reflecting perhaps Moore's reluctance to show a happy triumphant Christian ending. But Moore neglects to tell us the complete story or to allow us to see hints of the ultimate triumph.<br /><br />Romanticists will be sorely disappointed by ""Black Robe,"" demolishing as it does that nice little myth of the Noble Savage, which has never amounted to anything more than a childish fairy tale. Leftists, too, many not appreciate it, for though it depicts the characters from their own and from each other's perspectives, the reality is that pre-colonial Native American culture was often excruciatingly cruel: as Chomina himself confesses, he is as selfish and sinful as any white man. There is neither postmodern white guilt complex here, nor the crass Cowboy and Indian games of old Westerners. In fact, there is very little in this film with which to sympathise from the standpoint of the modern ""Enlightened"" liberal conscience, and thank God for that! At last we have a movie about real human beings defined by their own time. The cinematography, moreover, is stunning: one truly feels the profoundity of the loneliness in the vast empty continent of North America. One complaint, though: if Moore went to this much trouble to portray the Natives speaking their own languages and Abbé Laforgue praying in Latin, couldn't the French have spoken to each other in FRENCH and not English??",unsup

There are interesting characters, a variety of messages, lots of visualized information but no reduction to something easy to accept. No personable characters for whom we can forgive any deed or word, no overarching stirring message, no overblown hope. In fact, how did the film get so much complex reality in?<br /><br />While the clash of cultures is presented, so are the clashes within cultures -- notably among the first nations but covering conflicts among Europeans as well. The film does not reduce the lives of its characters to any simple clash, theme, or plot.<br /><br />The reductionist aspect to the film is the undercutting of the way that people structure their lives around traits, values, kin, enemies -- these meanings are shown, by contrast among cultures and by plot development, to be insufficient and misleading. We cannot identify with the characters because their loves and ideas are shown to be misguided.<br /><br />I felt invigorated and depressed when I saw it on the screen and again on TV. Unlike the morbid European art films of the 60s that showed the meaningless of life by inventing meaningless lives, ""Black Robe"" shows people immersed in rich lives -- hard, beautiful, complex, compelling. While the plot may be slow, each scene draws you into a ton of immediate new reality, so you sense you are learning a lot about how people lived and believed and felt. By letting the characters glimpse the error of their constructions -- the insufficiency of love, the limits of faith, the death of kin, the hollowness of stoicism -- the director erodes our own hope for that most human of activities, giving meaning to life.<br /><br />I think this is among the best films ever made. Certainly something like Citizen Kane is childish by comparison.",unsup
10151_0,"While living abroad several years ago, I bought this DVD to watch and to remind myself of Canada. I have travelled to all of the places depicted, sometimes by canoe. The film wanders inaccurately to locales in the wrong direction and as a historian at Ste-Marie among the Hurons (in Midland, Ontario) once explained to me, 'Black Robe' is at best an imprecise amalgam of the trips of different people over different years. Does this matter?<br /><br />I have shown 'Black Robe' to foreigners abroad but in my experience, something goes missing in the translation. The film seems too simple, too boring or too brutal. But to foreigners who visit Canada and see the space and the distance (rocks and trees!), the film presents a dimension of the country, in fact the continent, that is hard to fathom otherwise. 'Black Robe' is an honest attempt, accurate I think, to portray the initial meeting of two civilizations in a place without people. It is much more accurate, in my opinion, than 'Dances With Wolves' or even 'The Mission'. My advice? If you are not American, watch this film either before or after a trip to the wilds of North America. If you're a prof, show this film to students but lead a discussion before and after with care.<br /><br />Lastly, two scenes I liked in particular: 1) Lothaire Bluteau forlornly taking a crap off the side of a canoe (very tough to do) and 2) the comparison of the spires of trees and the spires of church columns. We all should feel small, and the quietude, abandoned in a North American forest, or a European cathedral.",unsup
10152_0,"This film is often compared with Dances With Wolves, which is certainly understandable, but personally I feel that Black Robe is the better film, both in terms of art and fidelity to historical fact. I am a history graduate student in New York currently teaching an undergraduate class in the Bronx on early U.S. history, and Black Robe is just about the only film I have no hesitation showing to my students.<br /><br />As a portrait of life in New France (now Eastern Canada) in the early to mid-1600s--when Samuel de Champlain was the leader of the tiny French outpost of Quebec--this film is virtually flawless. The complex relations between ordinary French colonists (almost all male), French Jesuit priests, and Native American tribes in the region (primarily Algonquian, which is a very broad category encompassing many distinct tribes) are rendered with a wonderful degree of accuracy, at least in my opinion. Colonists in New France generally took greater care than other Europeans--particularly the Spanish and the English--to have amicable relations with native people's they encountered. This is evident from the film but is not overemphasized, as we see the obvious conflicts between the French and their nominal Indian allies.<br /><br />Black Robe's take on religion during this time period is smart, and illustrates some of the similarities between native and European beliefs while demonstrating the latter's contempt for native religion (the main character--""Black Robe,"" a term many Algonquians used both in the movie and in historical fact to describe the French Jesuit priests--is the primary example here). The Native Americans we encounter in this film are not portrayed in some idealized, pre-historic fashion, but rather as complex, violence-prone tribes as was actually the case. This does not diminish our sympathy for them and the difficulties they face as a result of the arrival of Europeans--as it should not--and instead actually shows the great extent to which Native Americans in early colonial history had power and affected the course of events.<br /><br />I write this review mainly as a student of history, but in terms of the art of cinema I think Black Robe is also excellent. The film is beautifully shot, and the characters are drawn with a fair amount of complexity. It is a very ""un-Hollywood"" film (being Canadian) which probably partially explains why it succeeds. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this period (the ""American"" colonies during the 1600s) or anyone who was intrigued by films like Dances With Wolves or Last of the Mohicans. This film has no big stars or Hollywood-style love story (such as the one that made Last of the Mohicans essentially unbearable to watch) but it does a great job presenting the complex dynamic between Native Americans and Europeans during the colonial period. Serious students of history (including teachers looking to show a film about Native-European relations) will find much to appreciate in Black Robe, and I think anyone who likes an interesting film even if it does not have famous actors in it will as well.",unsup

Everything about it is perfect, costumes, photography, writing, etc. The soundtrack is great, majestic, moving. I caught it a few times on TV, and it captured me again. It really does transport you to another time and place, you can feel the cold, and smell the air. Lothaire Bluteau is so sad, seems lost, but believes he is doing the right thing. The Indian sex scenes are interesting, that is something that is not often depicted, the freedom of their sexuality. This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it.",unsup
10154_0,"""Black Robe"" is a film I have seen at least a dozen times and it continues to cause utter astonishment. The highest quality that any art can have is the ability to arrest the mind of the viewer. Days later imagery is still flooding back to you -- feelings -- ideas -- and of course questions... But questions that properly have no easy answers. The first time I saw this film was about 15 years ago when it was first released. I watched it in a Toronto cinema and afterward emerged into a warm and noisy downtown night, crowded with people, signs, lights cars taxis subways et cetera. Immediately, I was in culture shock. The movie had so taken me into the world of 17th century Canada that I could not adjust to the reality of 20th century Canada. It still has that effect. Astonishing.",unsup
10155_0,"This film made major concessions to political correctness in its portrayal of the Indians, who are depicted in a considerably more flattering light here than they are in Brian Moore's novel. This could also be considered the romanticizing ""Dances With Wolves"" effect. The novel drew some (unjust) criticism here in Canada for its uncompromising approach.<br /><br />The actual history is fairly readily available. ""The Jesuits in North America in the 17th Century"" by the great American historian Francis Parkman is the standard 19th c. work on the proselytizing efforts of the French Récollet and Jesuit fathers.<br /><br />Still, if you are not very familiar with the subject, this film is a strong, and quite gruesome, introduction. I'm not aware of a lot of films about the colonial period which are as tough. Not ""Last of the Mohicans"", or the adult westerns from the '50's, in my opinion. ""Little Big Man"", perhaps. Or possibly ""A Man Called Horse"", which I haven't seen. The priest in the story is a composite of actual missionaries, and the impact of this historical adventure thriller is heightened for me knowing that everything in this film happened, and often a whole lot worse.<br /><br />The rights and wrongs, the pros and cons, of the cultural collision of Europeans with the autochthonous peoples are still too contentious, so I would rather not get into them. There is a lot here to brood about afterwards, and chances are good that you'll seek out a copy of the novel -- it's not very long, and a lot easier to read than James Fenimore Cooper. If you're American or Canadian, this is an important part of our shared past.<br /><br />""Black Robe"" is one of the very best Canadian feature films, with a solid cast led by Lothaire Bluteau with August Schellenberg and Tantoo Cardinal in support. The presence of an Australian director, Bruce Beresford, perhaps kept the film from turning into a well-meaning but dry Canadian history lesson.",unsup

And he presents the complexities of culture anew in this film.<br /><br />I was struck by the absolute beauty of Québec and the film's cinematography.<br /><br />Back to Laforgue for a moment: here is a protagonist that accomplishes his mission with wisdom, intellegence, prayer, dependence upon his faith, lack of violence, and persverance.<br /><br />",unsup
10157_0,"This film is brilliant, because it defies conventional stereotypes of European settlers and American Indians. This movie strives and succeeds in its portrayal of Indians and whites as human beings, rather than as villains or saints. Those who feel this movie would show the Indians as noble savages will be gravelly disappointed. The Indians in ""Black Robe"" can be cruel, and have sexual mores that would disgust the more prudish viewers. The affect of the Jesuit missionaries among the Indians of Quebec is not romanticized or glossed over, nor are the Jesuits shown as evil white devils. All humans in this movie have their flaws and weaknesses and all act ""morally"" according to their own cultures' expectations. Beresford has crafted a marvelous film that ought to be required viewing in college history courses across the country.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful, whether we are watching the gilded altars of the cathedrals of Renaissance France, the iridescent glow of a fire at an Indian village, the cramped quarters of an Indian longhouse, or the awesome and heavenly magnificence of the Canadian woodlands and what appears to be the St. Lawrance River. This movie does feature explicit sexual acts and gruesome violence, so I would not recommend this movie at all for very young children. I think most teenagers can handle this film. I suppose this film is very hard to find at your local video rental store, but do yourselves a favor and find it. Your efforts will be amply rewarded.",unsup

Sabotage?<br /><br />""Black Robe"" invites comparison with ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" another masterpiece. Two great directors project their vision of two different men who do something we in this ""civilized"" culture can hardly imagine: plunge into a vast, unknown, alien world. And ultimately into oblivion.<br /><br />The motivation, the source of courage, is faith, on one hand, and hubris on the other. Watch both examples. Though we can easily discern the noble from the base, we experience equally powerful stories. Here is a chance to see juxtaposed two profoundly different outlooks subjected to a common ordeal. What a wonderful, terrifying, soul-shaking thing to witness!",unsup
10159_0,"I noted that this movie was being compared to Dances with Wolves and Last of the Mohicans,aside from the fact that they all three involved native Americans there is little comparison.Windwalker would be a better comparison. This movie is more about this character who is being driven by a fierce passion to save a people and culture he doesn't understand and doesn't want to. It's Man vs. Nature. God vs. Nature. It draws a far more fierce and savage picture of Native Americans than most films dare to in an effort to stay PC which sometimes means pretending a victim or minority is without fault. This character,this ""Black Robe"",is most certainly flawed, but his courage in the face of savagery is inspiring. Also the native Americans in this film seem far more human and less a Hollywood caricature of native Americans. I plead with every movie lover out there SEE THIS FILM. I felt I was truly transported back in time. So, if you are avoiding this film because you hated Dances with Wolves and fell asleep every time you tried to watch Last of the Mohicans, try this film instead.",unsup
1015_0,"I was recently given the Anchor Bay DVD release of this title as a present, and I have to say that while I am impressed with the usual European frankness about things that would never make it into American films, this is probably among the least of Paul Verhoeven's work. Not that this is bad from the get-go. I would far prefer to watch a bad film from Paul Verhoeven than what could be considered good among the stables of directors like Peter Jackson or Jerry Bruckheimer. They say that the key to artistic success is being honest with yourself, and Verhoeven is a big example of the principle. More on that in a moment.<br /><br />The story of Keetje Tippel concerns itself with a young woman named Keetje, who migrates from one end of Holland to another during the nineteenth century. The name might be obvious from the title, but one thing that should have been made clearer is that Tippel is not her family name. Tippel actually refers to the profession she winds up taking in order to fuel her rise from the gutter.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film, Keetje is an idealist with little, if any, idea of how the capitalist society she enters actually works. She starts out going from one crappy job to the next. The first of which makes it clear that worker health and safety was a very minor concern at best in this primitive era. We see Keetje and numerous other workers dipping textiles into lye, no gloves or any other kind of protection, and we see its effects at various stages in the film. From there, Keetje falls into working as a seamstress, and eventually, as a prostitute.<br /><br />One touch of Dutch cinema that I've always liked since I have become acquainted with it through Verhoeven's work is that there isn't always a happy ending. In Keetje Tippel, our titular hero does nothing to help the poor that she was once a member of. In fact, one of the many things she winds up doing in the latter part of the film hurts them very badly. This can be understood when one looks at some attitudes to what people feel when they get out of a situation they cannot stand. For example, were I to leave Australia and live somewhere like England, the only way in which I would lift a finger to help others who are unhappy with the lot Australia has is by helping them leave. Like rats from a sinking ship, as it were. That's the attitude of the character, and it is even more understandable in the context of nineteenth century social conditions.<br /><br />The thing that keeps Keetje Tippel from obtaining the unqualified ten out of ten rating I normally give Verhoeven's Dutch-language films is, ironically, the same thing that normally prompts this rating. For once, the brutal honesty and unflinching depiction of reality counts against the film. Rather than the stomach churning for a second before expressing amazement, I found myself asking if the depiction of bodily functions is really necessary. Those who have seen the uncut versions of Soldaat Van Oranje, Turks Fruit, or even De Vierde Man, will understand what I am talking about here.<br /><br />During the audio commentary Anchor Bay had recorded for the DVD release, the difference between Verhoeven and many a Hollywood director becomes obvious in a big hurry. Where other directors will attempt to put a spin on every aspect of their films, or even try to congratulate themselves, Verhoeven is so frank and honest that his commentaries could be used in film-making schools. Unlike Peter Jackson and his vapid writing staff, you won't hear Verhoeven trying to justify his artistic decisions from a position of arrogance. It's not ""how do you expect me to do this? do you think you can do better?"", but rather ""I did this this way because... and I am pleased/disappointed with the results, so I will do it again/try something else next time"". If all directors in Hollywood were this brutally honest, American film would be much more palatable nowadays.<br /><br />I gave Keetje Tippel an eight out of ten. Its realism earns it a ten out of ten for the most part, but there are times when it either goes too far, or lets its ambition exceed its ability enough, to deduct two points. Jan Wolkers, the author of the novel on which Turks Fruit is based, had similar feelings about Turks Fruit, so this is quite easily viewed as a case of a new director faltering a little as he learns his craft. Still, with early pieces like Keetje Tippel and Turks Fruit, it is not a surprise that Verhoeven would go on to such masterpieces as Total Recall or RoboCop. The DVD is well worth the Amazon asking price.",unsup
10160_0,"I'm a history student of second grade of a french canadian university. So, in a history point of view, I can assure you that this movie is simply amazing. The story is about a jesuite priest who wants to bring catholic faith to the Indians of the french colony Nouvelle-France (New France, the future Quebec of Canada) in the seventeen century. In fact, there was a lot of jesuite doing that by that time. The priest and his young translator ask the Algonquins natives to guide them to the Hurons natives. That is also exactly correct! But in their quest,they had some problems with the Iroquois natives. And that is exactly right! At the end, the priest reach the Hurons. The chief of the tribe tells that if they accept the god of the priest, they will become weak and their ennemies will kill them. And that's what's gonna happen! In fact, the Hurons were the first Indians of New France to accept catholic religion. I saw the movie with the french dubbing. The Indians of that time didn't knew how to prononce R. So, in the movie, they say : obe noie, instead of Robe Noire (Black Robe). I don't know if they said black obe in the English version. In one scence, the priest tells the Indian sorcerer that he is reading a breviaire (book of prayers). And the sorcerer said: beviaire, witout the R. The way the natives are dressed and wears their hairs is also very exact in an historical view. This is not only a great movie, but an amazing reconstitution. Natives actors are great, with August Schlleberg, the always good Tantoo Cardinal and the charming young Sandrine Holt. Lothaire Blutheau is one of the best french canadian actor (see him in Jesus of Montreal). This is absolutely a superb piece of work ! And some kind of perfect history book.",unsup
10161_0,"Wow, what a fascinating movie and different kind of film. One really can't get the full impact of this through a review. Anyone who has seen this, I think would agree with me on that.<br /><br />If I had skipped over the credits and someone had told me Terrence Malick (Days Of Heaven, The New World, The Thin Red Line and Badlands) and directed this film, I would have believed it. Visually, this is his kind of film. I wonder if this movie inspired parts of his latest effort, The New World? There are a number of similarities. Black Robe has the same kind of beautiful and haunting images Malick's films possess but the director in this case is Bruce Bereford, the man who directed Driving Miss Daisy a couple of years before doing this film. DMD also is beautifully-filmed.<br /><br />Black Robe is not just a piece of art. As great as it is visually, this is a powerful story of a well-intentioned Jesuit priest in the early 17th century who travels to ""New France"" (upstate New York/French Canadian territory) attempting to convert a few area tribes to Christianity. To unbelievers, that seems pushy but Biblically-speaking it is not. Jesus commanded his followers to do just that (Matt. 28:18-20) , so the priest is only doing what missionaries have done for centuries. He also is a good man, stays strong in his beliefs regardless of his own well-being and is a gentle soul. Kudos to the filmmakers for being fair to him.<br /><br />The Algonquins and the Hurons are also shown with their beliefs, too, and their cultures which obviously were in contrast to the white European-based priest. All sides are shown fairly in this movie, with both positive and negative traits of all.<br /><br />I was shocked at a few scenes in here, not expecting them as the film has such a gentle flow to it before anything dramatic happens. We see a few sexual scenes and then some brutal violence. The Hurons, particularly, do not want any invasion of their privacy and culture and are openly hostile to the priest and the Algonquins. The story transforms from a quiet Malick-type ""New World"" poetic piece to a violent, suspenseful film and the question is, will the ""good guys"" make it out alive?<br /><br />The actors in here, perhaps, are not names most people outside Canada are familiar with, including me, but Lothaire Blueteau as Father Laforgue, Aden Young as his assistant ""Daniel"" and Sandrine Holt as Daniel's Algonguin lover ""Anuuka"" are all very, very good. All the characters in this film are very credible people, steadfast in their own beliefs and they come across as realistic people. Most films have unreal people with unrealistic dialog....but not in this movie.<br /><br />Another big plus was the soundtrack: a lush, haunting score throughout.<br /><br />Without spoiling the ending, or adding political/theological agendas my own, let me just add that if you enjoy a beautiful-looking movie which also has a thoughtful, haunting story with honest characters, you should check this out. Highly recommended.",unsup
10162_0,"This exquisitely photographed film portrays the cultural clash between Europeans (in this case the Europeans happen to be French) and various native tribes in seventeenth century North America without romanticizing either French culture or that of the native peoples.<br /><br />Perhaps the most striking feature of this film from my perspective was utter arrogance of the Europeans to come into a wild country presuming the superiority of their way of life over that of the indigenous peoples. No character seemed to understand that better than Father LaForgue, admirably portrayed by Lothaire Bluteau. The good Father soldiers on despite the evidence that his presence in the vast wilderness of North America won't make a whit of difference in his life or in the lives of the people he has vowed to introduce into ""paradise."" The Algonquin guides worry about their attachment to the ""demon"" LaForgue and wonder whether they shouldn't just kill him. Even LaForgue's young assistant, Daniel, wonders how the presence of a French missionary makes the the native people's lives any better. The Iroquois, who suffer from a harsh depiction in the film, take a more economically-based view of LaForgue -- he and Daniel are seen by the Iroquois as currency to be exchanged for guns.<br /><br />An aside concerning the Iroquois. While the violence depicted in the film is no doubt accurate, what the film does not reveal is that the Iroquois likely became decidedly more hostile when the French began to assist old enemies, such as the Algonquin, in traveling into hunting grounds that had previously been Iroquois territory.<br /><br />But back to LaForgue, whose journey is the primary emphasis of the film. He has journeyed, apparently from a life of some privilege in France, leaving behind a doting mother and (perhaps) a beautiful young woman. He has journeyed away from the ""pleasures of the flesh,"" lingering on the sight of a couple making love in the communal tipi and later admitting to Daniel that he, LaForgue, lusts after the young Alogonquin woman,Annuka, with whom Daniel had already struck up a sexual relationship. He gets lost on the journey in the cathedral-like forest and rejoices and being found by Algonquin hunters, who express some bemusement that the Black Robe got lost in the first place. Finally, he journeys to the Hurons and a village beset by smallpox, where baptism has been sold to the natives as a miracle cure as much as it has a key to salvation.<br /><br />By avoiding the tendency of films depicting Native American life to romanticize, Bruce Beresford has captured more profoundly the daily harsh realities of life for the peoples inhabiting the northeastern portion of North America at the arrivals of the first trickling of Europeans. Neither way of life is ultimately depicted as superior to the other: each simply is. This is not a ""feel-good"" film. Instead it is a realistic, thought-provoking tale of a journey of a man, of cultures, and of life itself. Simply a brilliant film.",unsup

David Lloyd George (The British Prime Minister) and Douglas Haig (The General commanding the British Army) hated each other and after the war DLG got his memoirs into print very quickly - this led to the myth that the British Army was led by bungling officers and sacrificed for nothing.<br /><br />This show plays on that myth - In an extremely funny way. Alas - it also helps rob the British Army of its finest victory. <br /><br />Despite that I love this show - they visit so many of the controversial sides of this conflict in what is at times a side achingly funny way. The end is especially poignant.,unsup
10164_0,"The final series, this time focusing on WWI. Part of what makes this one work so well is that they point out the negatives of war, especially the more traditional battles, so marvelously; the officers are devoid of a sense of reality beyond their comfy chair and desk, the assignments all contain the unwelcome promise of certain and meaningless death, boredom is rampant during a lot of the waiting, and the front runs out of supplies and the substitutions... you don't want to know(not sure why they felt the need to go into such detail about it, much less have so many of that type of jokes, but I digress). Melchett returns, as a stark raving mad superior, adopting the obnoxious, loud behavior of Laurie, and the two, individually or, better yet, together, lead to many an eye-rolling, funny and memorable moment. McInnerny is back, and going by his wish to avoid being typecast as the innocent, and remarkably stupid, Percy, he instead is cast as a slimy rival to Edmund, with the unbelievably(though based on an actual poor bugger) unfortunate surname of ""Darling"", creating an utterly hilarious running gag. This has a fantastic main group. The verbal, clever, British material is still going strong, immensely so, and this holds numerous of the greatest lines of the franchise. Satire is also magnificent in this, and it comments on more or less every aspect one could think of, relating to the period and situation. The plots are interesting, well-written(as really everything in this) well-thought out, and rather surprising. Acting is all great, and the guests are impeccable, including the always spot-on Richardson. Blackadder himself isn't downright depressing as he was in the third, which is not to say that the bite and snark that we do love so are gone, not by a long shot. Every episode is excellent, and the ending of the final one is beautiful. The comedic timing is flawless. There is silly stuff, in-between the wit. Almost all of it garners deserved laughs.

I would say that Blackadder Goes Forth is the best out of all four Blackadder series, and I think it deserves its rating of 9.0/10 on average. A very enjoyable view indeed. Blackadder should be seen by everyone, as it is a comedy of many colours.

Not so with Blackadder Goes Forth, the best of the Blackadder television comedy.<br /><br />Set during the First World War in 1917, this version of Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) is now a Captain of the British Army on the Western Front. He is joined with his trusty moron sidekicks Lieutenant George (Hugh Laurie) and Private Baldrick (Tony Robinson). In the Army headquarters are the idiotic General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and scheming Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny). Throughout the series Blackadder tries his best to avoid being sent over the top, he made it that far. This series looks at many aspects of the war, the growth of popular and army culture, the growth of the air force, the lost of Russia, the use of court-martials, etc...<br /><br />The First World War is an usual subject for comedy, especially because of the massive lost of life and the first time many countries suffers the affects of total war. What the writers Richard Curtis and Ben Elton do is turn the series in a dark comedy, a satire of the affect of the war the lost of live and the leadership of the British army; similar to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece Dr. Strangelove. Both writers are famous for left-wing, anti-war opinions. The show also tries the mick of the British upper class attitude. The series doesn't dishonest the memory of the soldiers who sufficed their lives for their nation. But the series does poke fun at some historical events and people, like war poetry, the Christmas Truce, the Red Baron and Field Marshall Douglas Haig. The writing is top notch and extremely funny.<br /><br />The actors were on the top of their game. Blackadder and Baldrick are the best characters Atkinson and Robinson had played and are an amazing double act. Blackadder is fantastic as a schemer, whilst Baldrick is excellent as the fool. Hugh Laurie is also a very good comedic actor and his is delightfully naive as George who just sees the war as an adventure. Stephen Fry is also a talented comedian, and is great at satirising the leadership of the British army. Tim McInnerny is excellent as the protagonist of the series. There are great guest stars in the series, such as Rik Mayal, Adrian Edmundson and Miranda Richardson.<br /><br />Blackadder Goes Forth is a classic series with a number of great episodes.

All in all, a very entertaining finish to the Blackadder series.<br /><br />This has a rather grim World War I theme, but luckily there are brilliant jokes and plots to brighten up each episode. Blackadder is cynical and grumpy as usual, Baldrick is his stupid self and George is still very stupid and positive in this terrible war. General Hogmanay is also rather stupid and keeps making sure they are on the right track and doing what he wants. Captain Darling always has something sensible to say but the General never lets him. He has very strong opinions but is not very strong himself.<br /><br />The cast:<br /><br />The cynical, intelligent Blackadder: Rowan Atkinson. The lovable, stupid, hopeful Baldrick: Tony Robinson. The stupid, jolly General Hogmanay: Stephen Fry. The weak but strong-minded Captain Darling in the background: Tim McInnerny.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who enjoyed the previous Blackadder parts, anyone who likes British humour and anyone who likes good grown-up humour. Enjoy! :-)",unsup
1016_0,"""Keetje Tippel"" is one of Verhoeven's lesser known movies but it really deserves to be seen and better known, all over the world. Reason why it isn't known better is I think because of ""Turks fruit"" from 1973. After that movie people expected this movie to be a sort of ""Turks fruit 2"", also because it was once again directed by Verhoeven and had Monique van de Ven and Rutger Hauer as the two main leads. ""Turks fruit"" and ""Keetje Tippel"" (and in a way also Verhoeven's earlier movie ""Wat zien ik"") show some similarities in the way the story is told but it are in fact of course two totally different movies.<br /><br />The movie provides a pretty good and insightful view of life in late 19th century Amsterdam. The atmosphere of the old Amsterdam is perfectly captured by Jan de Bont's cinematography and by the costume design and art direction.<br /><br />What makes ""Keetje Tippel"" better than the average period drama is the directness of the story telling. This is of course thanks to Verhoeven's typical style of directing that always is very direct and straight to the point. Once more the movie features quite some nudity and confronting scene's. But it all works well because it serves a purpose in the movie and it's obviously not only put in it to simply shock the viewer in a cheap way. The movie however is quite short and it didn't feel that the movie covered the entire story and the ending is abrupt and not entirely satisfying because it still leaves a bunch of questions unanswered.<br /><br />The acting isn't always top-class but this is more because of the simple dialog, rather than its the actors their fault. Rutger Hauer however deserves credit for his role and he plays his character in a very believable way. Monique van de Ven is good for about 70% of the time but her acting really pushes it at times and her character at times goes a bit too much over-the-top. The movie further more features a good supporting cast.<br /><br />The story is always interesting and you never know what is going to happen next, thanks to the unpredictable and realistic characters that are being portrayed in this movie. The movie is based on the real life of Neel Doff, which gives the movie an even more realistic and confronting feeling.<br /><br />Better than your average period drama's. See this movie if you get the chance.<br /><br />8/10",unsup
10170_0,"There are few shows that keep me coming back for more, or that I would pine for to see a new version of, but Blackadder is one of those shows. You need only look at the great writing and great acting to see a show that will forever stand the test of time.<br /><br />Blackadder goes Forth is pure genius, tinged with sadness- on this occasion Blackadder is yet again obnoxious, ruthless and selfish, but in the aim of doing something we can understand- escaping the trenches of WWI. Desperation underpins everything he does. The real 'bad guy' is General Melchiot, with his hare-brained schemes, which, as Blackadder puts it, feels like 'pushing Field Marshall Hague's drinks cabinet another few inches closer to Berlin'.<br /><br />Such lines as 'I'm as British as Queen Victoria' 'So you're father's German, you're brothers are German and you're cousins are German?' are rattled off with accomplished acting skill and timing. Like I said, this show is pure genius.<br /><br />The ending just serves to highlight the tragic nature of WWI, and the futility faced by all in the trenches. It's a touching moment, that makes you stop and think.",unsup
10171_0,"SERIES FOUR BLACKADDER GOES FORTH ""I'm the last of the tiddly-winking leapfroggers from the golden summer of 1914. ""<br /><br />In many ways the final series was the most dark and poignant. The hero of this series finds himself as a captain in the first world war holed up in the trenches with his batman Baldrick and his lieutenant George, played as a simple and well meaning fellow again by Hugh Laurie. Two of the regulars are back in the fold, Fry and McInnery as the HQ planners who our heroes are constantly trying to foil. Many ways are found to try to get out of the war, from becoming war artists to pretending to be mad a plan that will never work as Blackadder points out, ""who would notice another mad man around here?"". There are two great pairings in this, the jaded and career soldier Blackadder balances nicely with the upper class and enthusiastic George. Also back at HQ Lord Melchet (a sort of General Haig figure) makes a substitute father figure for the put upon Captain Darling. The piece of the show that always sticks in my mind is the ending, despite all of their schemes and plots the day comes when they have to go ""over the top"" and the final scene sees them running slow motion to certain death, not what yo would expect from a lesser comedy.<br /><br />Captain Blackadder: Don't forget your stick Lieutenant Lieutenant George: Rather, sir. Wouldn't want to face a machine gun without this.<br /><br />this one interchange between the two sort of sums up the hole absurdity of the situation, there's nothing so ludicrous as reality I suppose.<br /><br />Blackadder spanned nearly a decade and evolved from a cult show for deranged history buffs to prime time viewing for all and allowed for some memorable characters and scripts along the way, we may never see its like again. Fifth series anyone?",unsup
10172_0,"Out of all the Blackadder series, this one was my favourite. My favourite character in it was General Melchett excellently played by Stephen Fry, but all of the other cast were down right brilliant as well. The writing was also top notch.<br /><br />It is World War 1. Captain Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) is in charge of a trench where the occupants are- the scruffy Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and the over enthusiastic George (Hugh Laurie). Away from the trenches is Blackadder's boss General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Captain Darling (Tim McInnery). The final episode sees Blackadder, Baldrick, George and Darling go over the top and get killed. That moment in my opinion is the most dramatic moment in a sitcom.<br /><br />All six episodes of this were hilarious. No matter how many times you see them, you can't stop laughing. They are very clever, full of intellectual hilarious gags.<br /><br />Best Episode: Private Planes- Series 1 episode 4: For the excellent guest appearances of Bottom duo Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonson.",unsup
10173_0,"On only a few occasions have I ever been reduced to tears by film or television - Blackadder Goes Forth is one such occasion. The first five and a half episodes are however pure comedy of the highest order. Whenever I watch Blackadder I simply do not stop laughing throughout the whole thirty minutes, the jokes come thick and fast, in fact they probably come a little too fast since quite often you'll find yourself in stitches at one joke and be laughing for so long you'll miss the next one.<br /><br />What is so brilliant about Blackadder Goes Forth though is how the gags cut right to the heart of the such sensitive material the stupidity of the British tactics and commanders is mercilessly exposed - and rightly so - with brilliant lines such as ""a war that would have been a lot easier if we'd just stayed at home and shot fifty thousand of our men a week"".<br /><br />In terms of acting as well Blackadder Goes Forth is way ahead of the usual standard for comedies. Rowan Atkinson is at the top of his game as the uber-cynical Blackadder still reeling from the shock of having gone from fighting colonial wars to fighting the much more heavily armed Germans. Melchett and George are done in a wonderfully over the top (no pun intended) manner by Fry and Laurie whilst Tim McInnery is absolutely stunning as the sly Captain Darling who'll do anything to avoid fighting. Baldrick is perhaps at his weakest in this series and at times seems like he is only there to deliver his (albeit great) catchphrase ""I have a cunning plan"". Meanwhile stars of previous series appear in various episodes adding variety to the show - they too put in strong performances especially Rick Mayall and Miranda Richardson.<br /><br />About half way through the final episode though the whole show changes and suddenly it dawns on the viewer that this is THE end. The tone is radically altered, Blackadder's sarcasm remains but it's not funny now, well at least not in the same way as it was before. It is at this point that Blackadder Goes Forth becomes more than just a comedy and completes it's brilliance as it now touches the heart as well as the head.",unsup
10174_0,"My first real introduction to WW1, began in 1964. That year the BBC broadcast a 26-part documentary detailing the outbreak and progress of this, 'The Great War'. <br /><br />As a teenager, I sat mesmerised, as the voice of Sir Ralph Richardson narrated in harrowing tones, failure upon failure in tactics and strategy with no other result than monumental casualty figures. Ever since then I have been 'hooked'. Here are some figures: just the first day's 'Battle of The Somme' resulted in a loss of almost 60,000 British soldiers. Some 20,000 were dead. That is one third of the number of Americans who died throughout the entire Vietnam campaign (and just look how many movies have been made about that). The 'Menin Gate' at Ypres commemorates the loss of 56,000 men. But they didn't just die; they vanished. The population of a small town were completely swallowed-up by the fury. And this is only one of many such monuments. Numbers like these compel you to stop - and think.<br /><br />The multinational disaster that was WW1 has been shunned by politicians and media alike. The only good thing to be said of the conflict is that it stopped. And it had to; the nations were completely drained of money and men. Ever since, it has been a military bete-noir of history. Nothing was accomplished but failure and nothing created but innumerable corpses. There was no victory, no triumph of good over evil. Even the enemy was obscure. It was a holocaust of good intentions. The war became a machine that simply ground youth into the mud. Appalling bloody battles like those of WW2 at least had a positive outcome. D-day, Iwo-Jima, Monte-Cassino, all eventually led to unequivocal victory. Each presented an opportunity for national pride and manly courage to be heroically presented on film. But not 'The Great War'. Apart from 'All Quiet On The Western Front', it has been left well alone. <br /><br />'Blackadder Goes Forth' then is not only one of the most hilarious comedies written - better than 'Mash' if you consider the contrast between its scope and its brevity - but it is also a fitting tribute to all those poor souls who toiled and died and were lost. <br /><br />'The team' handle their subject perfectly. Rowan Atkinson plays the knowledgeable and cynical middle-ranking officer. He is not a coward; he can see what's happening and just wants out. Tony Robinson, as Private Baldrick, embodies the millions of 'Tommies' who struggled in ignorance. Hugh Laurie plays the lieutenant with unquenchably boyish faith in his high-command. Stephen Fry - literally - is General Melchett, the remote, pompous, arrogant buffoon, touched with insanity. Tim McInnerny plays the role of a staff-officer, aware of, but indifferent too, the consequence of futile strategies. Until he is ultimately forced to confront them in the last episode: 'Goodbyeee'. <br /><br />Richard Curtis and Ben Elton's script is everything you could wish for. Their jokes touch upon all of the horrors to which soldiers eventually became innured: cold, wet, shortages, rats and death. <br /><br />And it is that last episode which raises the series beyond the level of simple comedy. In a brief twist at the end, we see 'the team' go over the top to face their own belated death. In slow-motion, their figures become engulfed by a hail of enemy ordnance as the theme plays haltingly on a single ill-tuned piano. Moments later, the scene segues into the poppy-reddened fields of their epitaph. <br /><br />I have the series on DVD and it reminds me as much as my photographs of the many hours spent wandering along the Western Front. <br /><br />Its characters seem to speak for the millions who can't.",unsup

Favourite line being Baldrick saying ""I could go on all night"" and Blackadder replying ""Not with a bayonet through your neck you couldn't"".<br /><br />All the performances are terrific and each episode is fantastic. I know at the time people were worried about the subject matter. But it was handled with great sensitivity, especially in the last episode.<br /><br />The previous series had always ended with the death of the entire cast but in a comedic fashion. This was was different. The way each character started to become aware of what was to come and for the first time start to be afraid was just wonderfully done and the closing scene has got to be the best end of any series ever.",unsup

Blackadder is always trying to get out of the war in any way possible with the (useless) help of his thick friends. General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Captain Kevin Darling (Tim McInnerny) are making sure he stays there for the big push.

10177_0,"While I can think of plenty of WWII comedies, comedies about WWI are few and far between. Okay, there is Chaplin's Shoulder Arms, but then I fail to think of anything - apart from these glorious 6 half-hour long pieces of British Comedy. There are reasons for this scarcity, most notably that hardly anything happened during the war, except that millions of soldiers died in their muddy trenches. Not much room for a comedy writer to get his teeth into, is there?<br /><br />Well, watch this and you'd be surprised how much one can squeeze out of that setting. The main angle is the absurdity of it all, which our hero, Edmund Blackadder, is fully aware of. Alas, he's the only one and so his cynicisms and sarcasms remain undetected by the other characters. The highlights of the series are thus Blackadder's one-liners (well, often a bit longer than one line).<br /><br />If you have grown up watching TV comedy US style only then you may find the conclusion of the series rather disturbing.<br /><br />",unsup
10178_0,"This forth and final series is perhaps the best of all the Black Adder episodes; it is also more of a tragi-comedy than just plain old slapstick perhaps because at the time (1989) the events of WW1 were very much in the minds of a lot of people, whether it be surviving soldiers or relatives.<br /><br />As such there was some controversy when it was first broadcast by the BBC for its apparent lack of respect to those who fought and lost their lives for the sake of freedom & democracy.<br /><br />However, in retrospect, this isn't strictly true because even with Episode One there is a tangible shift in tone from previous Black Adder series. Yes some of the slapstick tomfoolery is still there, mainly at the expense of poor gormless Private Baldrick. But in addition a lot of the supposedly funny lines do have quite serious undertones, and bely the real truth of the sheer lunacy & farce that went on during the real war.<br /><br />For those that know their 20th Century history, WW1 was seen as a complete disaster for all and sundry, especially for the British soldiers in the trenches, primarily because they were being commanded & told how to fight a war by the most repulsive upper-class morons that call themselves Generals that ever wore a uniform.<br /><br />This was plainly represented by the bumbling fool, General Melchett (a wonderfully bemusing performance from Stephen Fry). Melchett simply has no idea of what life really is like for the troops on the front-line while he prattles on 35 miles behind the front-line in some safe palatial mansion where the most dangerous hazard to his life is whether he can unscrew a cork out of a champagne bottle without it hitting him in the face.<br /><br />Melchett is a complete buffoon but only Captain Blackadder realises this; everyone else thinks the General knows what he is doing purely because of his rank & social standing. So it is no wonder that Blackadder wants to mutiny because it's a hard choice deciding who the real enemy is - the Germans or his own Generals. <br /><br />For example:-<br /><br />General Melchett: Are you looking forward to the big push?<br /><br />Private Baldrick: No sir, I'm absolutely terrified.<br /><br />General Melchett: The healthy humour of the honest, Tommy. Don't worry my boy, if you should falter, remember that Captain Darling and I are behind you.<br /><br />Edmund Blackadder: About thirty-five miles behind you.<br /><br />This dark humour is wonderfully interwoven with the usual witty lines thanks largely to the writers, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton. It is typically anti-war but with good reason, as Blackadder declares in one episode:-<br /><br />""with 50,000 men being killed every week who is going to miss one dead pigeon!""<br /><br />The madness of this war also draws our attention to those very same front-line troops such as Blackadder, Baldrick & Lieutenant George. Their living conditions are disgusting & the fear of being shot or bombed out of their trench a very real possibility.<br /><br />The humour is just an adjunct to the real horrors that are going on in their lives, and this is beautifully concluded in the very sad finale. No longer did the critics argue this series lacked any respect because come the final few minutes of Episode Six we were treated to the sad demise of all those soldiers fading into time and replaced by the infamous poppy fields that strewn Northern France.<br /><br />Blackadder Goes Forth is far more intelligent than a lot of sitcoms; the writing and acting is exceptionally good, and also underpins the true human sacrifice the millions of soldiers gave to their King & country while the smug & arrogant Generals went home to more medals, honours and riches than ever before.<br /><br />School children of today find reading about history boring & not very relevant. But thanks to this series I am sure young & old alike will find this far more interesting, absorbing, damming & shocking than any written word on the subject could ever say.<br /><br />War Is Hell!<br /><br />****/*****",unsup

It's a mashup of the latest (as of 1972) method acting chops, 50s lung-heaving melodrama and trendy Euro bleakness. <br /><br />Nobody behaves the way people so in this film. No one, backwoods or anywhere, talks in one halting monotone and walks only at one lumbering speed. Real humans speed up, slow down, cheer up, pipe down, loosen up, get down. <br /><br />Maybe Tomorrow is a useful Before/After teaching tool. Duvall shows fearlessness, eagerly wrapping his glottis around some stupid Hollywood-hick accent. It's the fearlessness he would use to be among that exclusive crew who, in a way, solved Actor's Pi. They finally found the near-mystical ability to transform themselves on screen at what seems like the DNA level.",unsup
1017_0,"I came across this film under the title ""Hot Sweat"" at my local video store, and rented it out of curiosity; I had seen many movies by this director, and always thought his work was severely underated. The movie really surprised me with it's unsensationalistic style and well done cinematography. Although the female lead is very beautiful, and manages to get undressed frequently, there is always a tension to her sexuality...she is forced to rely on it only because the audience is clearly made aware that on the other side is the penniless abyss. Rutger Haur plays totally against type as a foppish young bank officer who adopts her as his mistress.<br /><br />I think most people today think of Holland as a totally liberal and affluent country. This film goes a long way towards dispelling that stereotype, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a (sometimes brutally) realistic picture of 19th century life among the underclass in Amsterdamn. I liked it.",unsup
10180_0,"Like other reviewers, I was going to avoid this movie within the first few minutes because of its austere quality. Black and white, gritty, bare-boned filming and direction looking at awkward people in a strangely quiet way. <br /><br />A scraping by man that is one step away from Adam in implements scratching out a living suddenly comes by an ailing pregnant woman who he befriends and keeps alive by stretching the tight shoestring he's already living on, taut to its limit.<br /><br />But then, as the story unfolds, you realize it HAD to be shot in black and white; it had to have that raw, gritty quality. That's the nature of the story. That's the power of it.<br /><br />I agree, too, with other reviewers that if (as some of us have been theorizing) the woman and her child were written to be Black, that would bring several new levels of poignancy to every aspect of the film. And you can read that in as you watch and appreciate those nuances for yourself though they're not spelled out in the film. <br /><br />I also had the strange thought while watching of how great it would have been to have Johnny and June Carter Cash playing the leads, since this film was made in their heyday. But that's just me.<br /><br />Yet even as it is, this is a rare piece of coal that under the pressure of tough times shows itself to be a diamond. Not to be missed.",unsup

The characters have a limited range of expression, but what they feel and say is consistent and almost meditative.

It was like being transported back in time to a place I've never been, and was watching this story unfold as if it was actually happening right in front of me.

10184_0,"Based on a William Faulkner story, this movie has the dark, gloomy, but realistic look of his work. The art direction, lighting, and costume design shows that this is a low-budget film, but it doesn't make it corny. In fact, this adds much to the authenticity of what the South was like in the late 1800s. In addition, the film is in black and white; this helps make the depressive mood of the story.<br /><br />Like much of Faulkner's writing, the film is done in flashback form. It opens with a murder of a young man and the trial of the man who committed the killing. It then goes back twenty years earlier to a poor, Southern farmer, Jackson Fentry.<br /><br />Robert Duvall is simply wonderful as Fentry, a man who is cut off from most of the world. His character is lonely but yet a naive and caring individual as he finds an ill pregnant woman (Olga Bellin) while working on a farm as a caretaker. He takes her in and cares for her. Everything seems normal for awhile, but then two tragedies happen they lead up to the present opening of the film. <br /><br />Everything is tied in together nicely, making a great, yet sad ending. It brings up the questions: Which is better for a child? Heredity or environment? This sounds like an excellent film that I would give a 10/10. But what made me give it a 7 was the pace. The movie was incredibly slow. This is no action, and I knew it wasn't one, but the dry, drawling, Southern monotones that the actor's spoke made it boring.",unsup

Years later he refuses to vote guilty while a member of the jury in murder trial, and this story explains why.<br /><br />Faulkner is so tied to place that most attempts at filming his works fall short of conveying his intent. Tomorrow, however, really does look right, and only The Reivers has conveyed as much sense of place. Duvall's sensitive performance is played off perfectly by Olga Ballin's Sarah. She is whimsical without being fey and tragic without being lugubrious. Duvall's accent is a little trying at first, but once you listen for a few minutes, it resonates as the only possible way his character could express himself. The grinding poverty of the rural South from 1865 until after World War II comes across vividly. The tableaux depict the stark dignity of these sharecropper's lives as eloquently as Let us Now Praise Famous Men by James Agee and Walker Evans. Duvall has a right to be proud of this performance.",unsup

Duvall is this film, and he has made this kind of intense, honest character study his own (Tender Mercies, The Apostle, The Great Santini). The black and white cinematography is perfectly suited to the story and the acting. It works as a far more honest story-telling device than Spielberg's ""Schindler's List.""

10189_0,"This is an incredible film. Not only is it a near perfect visualization of something quite complex, the Faulkner literary style, but it shows Robert Duvall to be the genius that he is. His style is so understated that you might not realize that he is one of the two or three greatest actors alive, but this film will nail that reality home for you. ""Tomorrow"" is a heartbreaking story set in the deep south a generation after the Civil War, and the tiny sad tale of a man and a woman and their child. It is a tale of profound love felt by people who cannot eloquently express themselves in words due to their social circumstances, but speak volumes with their actions. And so does the film. Shot in a very modernist style, there are long pauses, long glances, uncomfortable silences, all just like real life. And the effect, in this case, is brilliant. I am proud to say that I have, in my life, known a few people like the people in this film, and I can tell you that the portrayals are precisely right. The costumes are flawless in their detail. (Duvall's shirt is held shut with a safety pin, a tiny detail that my grandmother noticed immediately as the way men used to do it when the button fell off - she saw it hundreds of times as a girl in the 20's.) I could go on and on, but if you have any interest in Faulkner, or the South, or post Civil War culture, or the human condition in its most effecting moments, you really owe it to yourself to see this little gem of a movie.

The story told is generally about a mother losing her child and her fight to retrieve him. You come to see some extreme situations that she is going through (some of them almost suicidal or might drive one crazy) in the belief that her son is still alive and that there is a way of getting him back.<br /><br />Anyway I'm not going to spoil this masterpiece of Spanish horror so GO SEE IT!!! It must not be missed! It's B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!<br /><br />enjoy the magic of the orphanage...",unsup
10191_0,"Laura used to live at this orphanage and when she grows up, she starts to prepare it for some disadvantaged children. She adopted a boy, Simon, with her husband Carlos. Simon has some friends that are not real and at first Laura plays along with it but there comes the ghost story. The first part of the movie is slightly scary but as the movie goes along and things happen, this movie turns into a huge mystery.<br /><br />No one knows what happened to Simon but when the truth is revealed, it comes as somewhat of a tragedy. I really liked the scary scenes and they weren't too sick, macabre, or heart stopping. The scenes were just perfect and they blended right into the whole mystery.

10193_0,"The Orphanage (2007) - directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and produced and introduced by Guillermo del Torro whose ghosts films El Espinazo del diablo and Pan's Labyrinth most certainly were the inspiration for the first time director. The films ""The Others"" and ""The Stir of Echoes"" also come to mind, as perhaps, Friday the 13 and the story of Peter Pan which may be the main inspiration for the film that looks at the story of the boy who never grew up and stayed in Neverland from the point of view of his mother. The orphanage is unsettling, scary, very moving and intelligent. It does not show the monsters, it implies. It makes us to identify with its main heroine, the orphan herself who after many years comes back to the very house she used to share with her childhood friends, also orphans and where she wants to open the house for the handicapped children. Little did she know that the old house has deep and horrifying secrets that may affect her life, sanity, and the lives of the dearest and closest to her. Very good film, creepy, and heartbreaking. The final moved me to tears.",unsup
10194_0,"This was probably the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was definitely a psychological thrill. Everything was perfectly crafted, and all tied together in the most fantastic way. A movie done similarly could be The Ring, or One Missed Call. Each ties all the little seemingly meaningless details together into a beautifully crafted horror movie. Most horror is pop out scares, or slashers, but this movie is among the few that is genuinely creepy. The characters are deep and come to life on a screen, they all have their own psyche state, and this movie is very believable. Currently I have been on a Stephen King movie rampage, and while they are creepy, I haven't come across one where all the details tie together as masterfully. They are definitely scary, due to SK's exquisite writing, and ideas, but most of them have less of psychological ramifications, that a movie like the orphanage. I absolutely loved The Orphanage. Appologies if some of this isn't coherent, I am watching 1408 while typing this submission.",unsup
10195_0,"Many movies inhere some kind of ""duality"" of meaning. There's what you see... and there's also what lies beyond. ""El orfanato"" (2007) is a picture successfully playing with this matter, putting it into focus.<br /><br />While watching it you'll start to wonder... will there be some real explanation... or something else. Is the protagonist losing her mind... or is she right. What happened... and why ! Are you willing to believe in ghosts ? Or are you seeking for the real ? Either way you'll be able to experience this interesting Spanish/Mexican picture by J.A. Bayona in a different way !<br /><br />The second fascinating thing to strike me in a positive way was the terrific interplay of sound, music and images. A frightening fusion. Music suddenly stops...voices appear...sounds... after a while I wasn't all too sure any more whether the sound was coming from the movie... or from outside... not a nice experience during a movie like this one ;).<br /><br />So after all I clearly recommend ""El orfanato"". It's a wonderfully written, acted, visualized and directed deeply frightening horror drama. Perhaps one of the best of its kind and if you enjoyed ""The Others"" I'm guessing you'll enjoy that one too !",unsup
10196_0,"Horror films are few and far between these days; in fact it's almost a dead genre in the west. Gore and torture pornography centred films like Saw and Hostel seem to have stole the foundations of horror and instead of focusing on truly scaring people through suspense, meticulous direction and script, these films focus solely on shocking people. Now, I'm all for shocking people in horror films; it kind of comes with the territory, but this is not solely what horror is. I usually regard a horror film as successful when a certain feeling or scene stays with me for a day after seeing it, if it can indent the terror, maybe even play with your mind after viewing it, the film has done its job. Therefore I now look to Asia for my horror because thankfully they still understand that while the genre must progress, it must also still scare. However, with the release of The Orphanage it appears I should also keep my eye on Spain. When first looking at The Orphanage's plot outline I was less than enthralled, in fact I almost didn't watch it. I've never liked haunted house films, even The Shining failed to impress me, which is seen as one of the best horror films of all time by most people. Due to this I almost passed this film up, but I'm glad I didn't because I've finally found a haunted house film that I not only liked but also could sincerely call horror. After saying this, even though in my mind this is possibly the best haunted house film I've ever seen it is still just that, meaning do not expect to watch this film and see it completely redefine horror because it doesn't. <br /><br />The plot has been done many times before and many of the characteristics of previous films find their way into this one. It tells the tale of a woman named Laura, who as a child lived in an orphanage for a number of years before being adopted. At thirty seven she brings her family back to her childhood home in hopes to turn the now abandoned house into an orphanage for the handicapped. Her son's innocent games with imaginary friends soon develop into something more serious and disturbing and everything starts going a bit strange Have you heard this one before? I'm sure you have, as you probably guessed the story involves strange paranormal happenings, ghosts, creeks in the floorboards and numerous other elements seen before. But even though you realise this while watching it, the knowledge that your watching a 'haunted house' film washes away and the film completely draws you into its story and world. This is done by taking everything about the genre that works well and simply focusing on making these elements the best they can possibly be without complicating things too much. For this the first time director Juan Antonio Bayona should be given huge credit. The film is perfectly paced, with the exact right amount of time spent at the beginning introducing the characters and making sure the audience is firmly rooted in Laura's character so that we experience everything with her as the film progresses. Due to this fine beginning everything in the film works much better for it, the scares have greater impact because we care what's happening to Laura and unlike some films they don't come at you in rapid succession. Like in a comedy where the joke is built up to the punch line, the scare is given enough support before scream moment and even though a lot of them have been done before, these ones actually genuinely scare. With there only being one location really used in the film, it appears the filmmakers had the time and resources to focus on using the house to create a natural atmosphere. Instead of showing off clever CGI effects and as much of the horror as possible, they opted for the subtle approach; creating suspense with excellent lighting and diverse camera work. This gives the film a more mysterious, realist feeling that helps make the film world that much more believable. One film you could quite rightly compare The Orphanage to is 2001's The Others. It has a very similar plot and almost the exact same setting, but for some reason it never affected me. This could be down to many reasons, but after watching The Orphanage I think the acting had a lot to do with it. Belén Rueda's performance as Laura is quite simply excellent. Like the direction she displays all the normal characteristics of a character, wrapped up in a surreal story during the course of the film; bewilderment, fear, insanity and all the other emotions a character must go though. But the reason why you care about her and feel so connected to her throughout the film is because she plays a mother perfectly. There is nothing more important to her than her son and she displays this so convincingly that when the end of the film hits, the affect of the conclusion resonates that much more because you feel the emotions that Laura feels. <br /><br />All in all The Orphanage is one of the best horror films of recent memory; it takes the 'haunted house' device and uses it in a way I don't think any other film in recent memory has. The directing is a triumph and has great help from superb acting by Belén Rueda and a mature understanding of how to craft a horror film. The only real negative of the film is its complete lack of originally, which is unfortunate, but it does give you a top quality representation of what it borrows from. Therefore if you can get passed this flaw and you want an atmospherically rich, well-paced, scary horror film then this is you best bet for modern cinema.",unsup
10197_0,"The story concerns Laura, who has returned with her husband Carlos and adopted child Simon to the large manor where she was raised in an orphanage as a child. Laura is determined to fix up the abandoned house and open it as a refuge for ill children. But from the moment she returns, the past begins to haunt her. It isn't long before she begins to see the children who she used to play with as a seven-year-old. And when Simon goes missing one afternoon, she's convinced that they have taken him hostage.<br /><br />THE ORPHANAGE is a refreshing horror movie. This is due to the fact that the film doesn't rely on scary CGI images nor cheap scare tactics. On top of that, little, little (little) blood is spilled in this chilling ghost story. On the contrary, the film relies on its characters, the atmosphere, the setting, and (let's not forget) a satisfying plot.<br /><br />What makes the film work is of the performance by the lead, Belén Rueda, who does such a great job playing the whole ""what's real/what isn't"" act. I believe this is Juan Antonio Bayona's directorial debut and he does a fantastic job. I'm looking forward to see more of his movies in the future. Also, I would like to add that the score was great as well as the beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />By the end, when the truth is revealed, it's satisfying but it has been done before in other films. It's a different ghost story and I have to stress the ""different."" It doesn't have the usual ""Boo!"" scares or ghosts in creepy make-up. The film allows the characters to develop so we care for them and a creepy atmosphere in a great setting. THE ORPHANAGE is a refreshing horror movie that is pretty unconventional.",unsup

I found that it was captivating to say the least, i immensely struggled to take my eyes of the screen at any moment at fear of missing a vital addition to the plot. The reason for this fear was due to the simple fact that there are lots of tiny clues which eventually all come together to conclude the film. There were so many twists and turns that at times the film is hard to follow and events seem randomly placed, however as the film progresses all secrets are slowly revealed. overall unfortunately there are some facts that remain to be a mystery but i will allow you to watch it and decide for yourself. overall a very gripping film that has been very cleverly made.",unsup
10199_0,I would have a hard time classifying El Orfanto as a horror film or a fantasy film since it brings in the best of both the worlds. The story moves along gently and lets the pieces of a puzzle fall into place with time. The direction and the screenplay was flawless and suit the pace of the movie. The entire mystery is portrayed through the eyes of Rueda and she does the job superbly as a protagonist. For a film involving spirits and ghosts I was expecting a lot of off the wall scenes. At the end I felt none of the scenes were induced and every scene was required to solve the pieces. This is a mark of a genius for a debut film maker like Bayona. 8/10.,unsup

10200_0,"El Orfanato (the Orphanage) is a very good movie. It has been a long time since I have seen a good film in this genre. The genre ghost stories I guess.<br /><br />The story is somewhat difficult and complicated to bring it down to a few sentences. In short I could say it's a story about a couple and son who live in a large mansion. One day the son goes missing and the couple start searching for him. It's important to find him soon since the boy needs medication. When everything fails, they call upon a medium. Then they find out about the horrible truth of the mansion's past...<br /><br />The acting is definitely worth mentioning. It's solid and believable. I really liked the leading character, Laura. A very caring mother who tries everything to find her son back. It's truly heart-breaking.<br /><br />There are some very good, sometimes scary, scenes in this movie. Although the major part of the movie is mystery, not pure terror. Slowly yet surely you find out exactly what has happened in that mansion.<br /><br />And then there's the really good ending.

10201_0,"This movie has already been compared to way too many classic and well-known contemporary horror films. That's because it's a classic story. A woman moves into the haunted house of her memories, discovers ghosts and a mystery, starts working it all out while a cynical husband states that it can't be real, and eventually resolves the pained past of what causes the haunting in the first place, thus leading to transcendence. There are creepy children, bumps in the night, and an old woman with shady motivations. It literally couldn't go wrong.<br /><br />And it doesn't. J.A. Bayona gets the help of famed Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro to float, move, and explore his way through dusty rooms, hidden basements, and creepy hallways. Belen Rueda plays a caring, compassionate mother who only wants to protect her son, though she makes mistakes that sometimes a mother makes. Creepy ghost children play hide-and-seek and treasure-hunt games, ultimately leading to a compelling twist. This movie is carefully designed and even holds a few surprises.<br /><br />Whereas it may not be the most original movie out there, it certainly has its place for an audience craving a good old fashioned horror movie themed around something other than idiots trapped in a room full of intricate torture devices. It's a very nice return to form, and it's probably something you should see before the grubby Hollywood execs put their dirty paws on it and turn it into a CUTITSACAT! glurge-o-mania.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB",unsup
10202_0,"The Orphanage is a very well made, good old fashioned horror. It tells of a woman called Laura (Belen Rueda) that returns to the abandoned orphanage where she was raised, with the hope of re-opening it for a new generation of children. During the course of the film Laura's child goes missing and she is forced to shelve her plans of re-opening. The event compels Laura to spend more time in the house hoping that her child will return and results in her confronting her sanity. In sticking to an old fashioned premise the films employs a various amount of techniques and methods commonly attributed to films of this genre. The highlights being the big old house, creepy visitors, strange occurrences and things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />It is quite conceivable to think that any film that utilises such clichés and generic scare tactics is doing nothing new and can be dismissed as being unoriginal and possibly unimaginative. To the contrary, in bravely addressing the very routes of the genre the director, and writer, have produced a masterpiece in contemporary horror. The film is an excellent rendition of the classic bedtime horror story, told with atmospheric direction and brilliantly placed plot occurrences. It is an emotional film that reaches to the very heart of fear whilst re-establishing the genre in the minds of contemporary cinema goers. The Orphanage is film that is intelligently made and will go on to become a definitive horror film, much in the same way as Jacobs Ladder, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Sixth Sense  all films that carry similar themes.<br /><br />Those that aren't familiar with those previous films or wish to have their thrills in the form of Saw or Hostel will no doubt find The Orphanage tame and those that get their kicks from Asian horror (Gin gwai, Ringu etc) could also feel begrudged. In a disagreement with these films The Orphanage doesn't allow itself to be drawn into using one scare technique and continuously exploiting it throughout, nor does it prey on teenage anxieties or irrational fears. Instead the film embarks on a much more intellectual (and bold) approach and investigates one of the most basic primeval fears, that of losing a child. In exploring such a fear it is only fitting that all the characters be played well, and they are. Their fall from grace and their reaction to the events are brilliantly complemented by the well directed and paced plot. The timing of the scares and the execution of them are also done to perfection. All of these qualities add up to the film being a refreshing experience that, consequentially, sticks two fingers up to the recent and predictably made horror films churned out by Hollywood (1408, Vacancy etc).<br /><br />Ultimately The Orphanage is an encouraging debut feature from the director Juan Antonia Bayona and shows a lot of potential. The film is dark, mysterious and harrowing like Guillermo del Toro's Pans Labyrinth - which also has child at the heart of the film. Both films also drive home the extreme capabilities of imagination and dissolution.The film is presented by del Toro and, in much the same way Tarantino presented Hostel, there is no real direct evidence of his efforts on the screen. Instead The Orphanage is more of a continuation of the style and characteristics associated with his film-making. Those that, like me, have been pining for a classical contemporary horror should look no further than The Orphanage.",unsup
10203_0,"I happened to be in Denver on business and the Denver film festival was in full swing. When I found out this film was playing at midnight on my last night in Denver, I jumped at the chance to walk 20 blocks one way (and in November) to see it. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I was not impressed in the beginning because the film seemed a bit derivative to me. I mean, just how many ghost stories concerning children are there? And with imaginary friends, too? I was thinking ""Amityville Horror"", ""The Shining"", ""Wicked Little Things"", et al ad nauseum. But, boy was I wrong! There are entire sequences that are reminiscent of classic fright films: of course the boy with imaginary friends, as mentioned above; but also a psychic and her entourage right out of ""Poltergeist""; there's a death I've seen before as well, I think out of one of the ""Final Destination"" films; and of course, the general outline--a ghost story set in an orphanage--is vaguely reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro's own ""The Devil's Backbone"". All the ghostly trappings we have come to expect from classic fright films are there as well, from mysterious noises and bangings to ghostly visions. I'm not saying that this film ripped off any other film; on the contrary, it was great fun recognizing all these classic fright moments, and they weren't done in an homage type of way--they stood on their own.<br /><br />I can't tell you the last time a film made me jump. It has been a long while since I've attended a film that made the entire audience jump. This one does it not once, not twice, not thrice, but several times. It is spooky and atmospheric in places, it has some jump scares, but it also has some out-and-out scares that are guaranteed to get to you, no matter how hard-core you think you may be.<br /><br />I do have to say that I guessed early on what happened in the end. I didn't know exactly why or how, but I did guess the cause of the haunting. I don't think it mattered, I don't think it was being hidden. I think it was obvious that the orphanage was haunted because of some terrible past event involving children (why else would you call it ""The Orpanage""?!). But the reason behind the event was solid and the way the protagonist finds the information is cool. Besides, wasn't it Alfred Hitchcock who said that it isn't the bomb under the table that makes the scene scary, it's the fact that you don't know when it's going to blow up that creates the tension. So it didn't matter that I understood early on WHAT had caused the haunting.<br /><br />And finally, the ending is bittersweet. It isn't a typical American ending in that everything is wrapped up and presented to the audience with a bow. It isn't a sanitized ending, and it isn't necessarily a perfectly happy ending. I like that. It seems more real to me. I hate the fact that we Americans tend to want a sugary sweet ending so we can walk out and smile about the film without any more thought given. In fact, the last American film I can think of that didn't deliver the sappy ending was Sandra Bullock's ""Premonition"", and it flopped at the theater.<br /><br />Another film that I would draw comparisons to is Kevin Costner's ""Dragonfly"". It is similar in theme in that it is pretty creepy and scary until the end when you have some resolution for the protagonist, but not a typically happy American ending--a bittersweet ending, much like ""The Orphanage"".<br /><br />Overall, I truly enjoyed this film. It was spooky, it made me jump, it was fun, and it had a good ending. I hope the director makes more like this.",unsup
10204_0,"Recent horror films seem more inclined to thrill than to chill. Such hits like ""Dawn of Dead"" and ""I am Legend"" are great movies, but their fear comes from intensity rather than dread. However, there have been a few good chillers out there, such as ""The Others"" and ""The Ring."" And now, ""The Orphanage,"" from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro, creeps its way into their ranks, while still being a genre-defying film.<br /><br />The story revolves around Laura, a woman who buys her childhood home in hopes of starting an orphanage for handicapped children with her husband Carlos. But soon their son Simón starts communicating with the orphans who used to live there. Thus, many spooky-doins' begin. And boy are they spooky. ""The Orphanage"" is certainly not the first film to use the ""creepy kids"" angle, but screenwriter Sergio Sánchez made the story original and engrossing enough to be wholly enjoyable.<br /><br />One of the creepiest factors of ""The Orphanage"" is its sound design. The house contains plentiful creaks and groans, which seem to come standard in all haunted houses, but the real frights come from the music. As well as being ambrosial to the ears, it has the power to induce an assortment of emotions. It can bring a tear to your eye, or make you cramp up in your seat from suspense.<br /><br />But the real enjoyment comes from the acting. Horror films are known for having some of the campiest acting out of all the film genres, but ""The Orphanage"" is one of those rare gems where the actors are so great they make you think, ""Yeah, maybe they really are experiencing supernatural phenomena."" And Kudos to Belén Rueda (Laura) for having the most range and believability in the entire movie. Her performance transcends the language barrier and makes you forget you're reading subtitles.<br /><br />To round out the film is the cinematography, and if Guillermo del Toro is involved, you know it will be stylish to the max. The manor-like orphanage is not the typical run-down creepy haunted house. It isn't so much haunting as it is hauntingly beautiful. And each of the places around it follow, suit such as the beach and the playground. Each scene is so elegant that it can be incredibly terrifying while still being gorgeously shot at the same time.<br /><br />Of course, ""The Orphanage"" isn't perfect. One of its weakest points is that it is a bit cliché. There are a bunch or creepy kids, there is a medium that contacts the dead, and, gosh, does that house ever shut-up? But with all that aside, ""The Orphanage"" is still a classy and mysterious haunted house movie that will keep you guessing (and screaming) until the end. Do yourself a favor and go see this film despite the subtitles.",unsup
10205_0,"Why is everybody giving so high ratings to this? Come on, the movie is absolutely boring! I'm not a hardcore horror movies fan, but I still enjoy watching one or two when there's something interesting to watch. Believe me, this is NOT one of those.<br /><br />""The orphanage"" is a long, boring, no-scares, no-suspense, and totally overrated flick that almost made me fall asleep. I could have forgive the story's lack of originality if its narrative or pace would have been good... But they weren't. However, there's no reason to panic because even if the script is bad, at least the characters and dialogue are very well done, right? WRONG. They are dull and very poorly developed. The mix didn't work at all and there were many scenes that seemed false or even ridiculous to me.<br /><br />What more can I say, lately is a common practice for me to consult some IMDb users's reviews before paying any serious attention to some foreign flick I don't know much about, but the truth is... I don't know if that will keep being useful for me. I mean... Boy, I expected way, way more of this one. It really doesn't deserve all the good treatment that has received here.<br /><br />The only two reasons for the stars I'm giving are the fine cinematography and the leading lady, who actually did a decent job with a bad material (well, at some moments).

10206_0,"This film is less like a traditional horror movie and more of a drama/mystery with strong supernatural elements. The setup is that Laura, who once lived at an orphanage, returns to the orphanage with her husband and son to start it up again as a place for special needs children. Of course, it all seems simple, but there are mysteries abound in this story and the revelations trickle in over the course of the tale.<br /><br />The film isn't particularly frightening, although it has a couple of jumpy moments. Rather than focusing on creating an atmosphere of fear, instead it works on drawing up sympathy for Laura's plight as events transpire against her and her family and the past comes back to haunt her. It's an interesting meditation on loss as well that had a wonderful potential to straddle the line between real-world and supernatural (but don't worry folks, it doesn't--it's firmly supernatural and you know it from early on). Nonetheless, that you could imagine this film working even if the supernatural elements were just in Laura's mind and that's a pretty good thing for the drama.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are all sound (although I noticed a couple of background gaffs, but I think you'd have to look for them), with clear direction, capable lensing and design. The actors all do a good job of rendering their characters (children fare believably enough) and Belen Rueda carries the film well as the central protagonist. The story itself doesn't reach any great depths, but unraveling the mystery with the film is enjoyable.<br /><br />It's nothing stunning, but in the world of horror films, it easily stands a shoulder above the regular flotsam that the genre tends to churn out. At that, it's no terrible film and could be recommended if you're looking for a relatively intelligent and well composed supernatural horror-type film. Just don't expect bloodbaths and constant shocks. 7/10.",unsup
10207_0,"There is something to the marketing of foreign films and the way Hollywood tries its hardest to fool the public into thinking it is an English language movie. By not allowing any characters to speak in the trailers, giving away their secret with subtitles, someone like me, knowing it's foreign, is able to get a glimpse at the style and tone without really learning anything about the plot to ruin my surprise upon sitting in the theatre. This aspect worked perfectly for Guillermo Del Toro's production of El Orfanato. I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, (I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else). I now ask what it is that all three of these films have in common? With thisJ.A. Bayona's feature debuteach is helmed by a Spanish director. I can't think of a better nation making movies right now; the Spanish are doing everything right and this film just adds to bolstering that argument.<br /><br />Bayona creates a mood and tone that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats, anticipating the scares that they know will shortly be coming. I was actually surprised how slow the introduction was and how carefully laid out all the story pieces were. We are led into this world, discovering the relationships between our lead roles and the vague past of the orphanage that once housed our heroine and now is about to become her home for special needs children. Like The Others, the spirits involved here are not necessarily violent or demonic. They have an agenda, for sure, but what may at first glance seem malevolent could be nothing of the kind. The orphans now haunting the establishment are only trying to play a game. By taking something you love, a scavenger hunt is begun. Following the clues is the only way the game can end and if successful, the children will grant you one wish. The rules are simple, except the circumstances are far from easily accessible. One must believe that the game can happen before he/she can truly take part. Without the belief that the spirits are in control, success can never be achieved.<br /><br />The cast is led by a remarkable performance from Belén Ruedawho, as it turns out, had a wonderful turn in Amenábar's latest Mar adentro. Her composure and beauty is shattered as she finds her son has been lost. Trying to keep herself together, taking in what the police, her husband, and the mediums enlisted to help on the paranormal aspect tell her, she is given the task to figure out for herself how far she is willing to go to find her son. Always captivating and never out of her element, Rueda carries the story and never looks back. The supporting players around her are all portrayed nicely as well. Fernando Cayo plays the husband watching his wife deteriorate before him while unable to open his mind to the possibility that what she says could be true; Geraldine Chaplin is magnificent as the psychic medium whose trance brings out a puzzle piece necessary to continue the game; and young Roger Príncep plays the child Simón with the right amount of innocence mixed with the knowledge and comprehension of his fate to help keep the bond between he and his mother strong.<br /><br />Bayona never goes for the cheap thrills either as he builds up the tension with sounds and visuals. His use of the closing doors and the moving merry-go-round add a sense of foreboding that ends up being more important than you may initially guess. Stylistically too, the transition between the house's current state of duress with the way it shone by the glow of the adjacent lighthouse from the past is expertly handled. There were numerous instances where the film could have gone off the rails to tragic effect, but he holds it steady throughout. More psychological than visceral, the scares are few, but effective. Even when the grotesque rears its head, it is to enhance the story, not to shock for shock alone. The sound work is utilized to the fullest too. What seems to be jarring and loud for the purpose to scare our lead and us is actually very important to the tale at hand. Nothing is shown or heard here that doesn't have absolute relevance to the film as a whole.<br /><br />The final third of the film comes quick and fully envelopes you into the proceedings. You are right there with Rueda's character as she slowly uncovers the secrets hidden behind the years that have past since she last lived in the orphanage. Whereas a film from Hollywoodof late usually being a remake from a better horror film in Japanwould use this tension in order to hide the flimsy and lackluster conclusion it tacks on so as not to alienate those viewers who enjoy leaving the theatre with a smile, Bayona knows how to effectively end his tale the way it should. I was blown away by the handling of the final scene and the way he used the rules of the game to transition us from one reality to another. It is truly a remarkable feat that hits home hard emotionally, but I will actually say also succeeded in me leaving with a smile on my face. Whether you exit the theatre with your eyes moistened or not, you will not forget the beauty and perfection for which it concludes. The tagline is correct, for while it is a story of horror, it is above all else a tale of love.",unsup
10208_0,"I am not much on horror movies. In fact, I'm known as El Pollo (The Chicken) when it comes to movies. For example, I hate movies which revel in violence: I would no more see ""No Country for Old Men"" than I would go quail ""hunting"" with Dick Cheney. Will I see ""Sweeney Todd?"" Sure I will -- just as soon as pigs fly out my rear end whistling the ""Colonel Bogey March."" <br /><br />But I went to see ""El Orfanato"" because I gathered that it was more of a ghost story than a horror film, and that it was more of a thoughtful reflection on The Unseen World, like ""Don't Look Now,"" or ""The Sixth Sense,"" than a movie whose main purpose was to scare the bejabbers out of the audience.<br /><br />And so it turned out to be. Which isn't to say that it didn't scare the bejabbers out of the audience! Several times.<br /><br />The film comes from Spain, and stars Spanish TV star Belen Rueda as Laura. We learn that Laura was an inmate of an orphanage, that she was adopted away from the orphanage, and that she has, at the present time, returned to the old property with her husband and adopted child to create a home for neglected children.<br /><br />This movie, like ""Sixth Sense"" (one of my all-time favorite films) is about love and death. In fact, I think they both share the same message, that is, that helping those most in need of help gives life meaning. <br /><br />I enjoyed ""The Orphanage,"" and I think you will too. If you just plain don't like being frightened in movies, then stay away. But there's no glorified violence and -- you know how the music builds and builds, more and more ominous, and the thing which is about to attack gets closer and closer? There is some of that, but mostly it's used as exposition -- it's when you're not really expecting anything that the director pushes the bejabbers button, leaving the audience chuckling -- like, ""whoo -- THAT was a GOOD one!""<br /><br />I think folks who like a good haunted house story will like this, and people who like a good love story will like it as well.",unsup

The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot).

1020_0,"There's a bit of unintended notoriety connected with the title of this film. You have to see the 1996 Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez writer-director collaboration From Dusk Til Dawn, an un-P.C. film if ever there was one, to get it. The movie's characters have set up shop at a trucker's and biker's bar, the Titty Twister, to cool their heels. The M.C. announces a new entertainer for the stage, a woman named Santanico Pandemonium. The voluptuous actress Salma Hayek steps out draped with a huge snake and little else, and proceeds to rock her hips to the delight of every man who can see her. It's a stunning moment toward the middle of a not very striking flick.<br /><br />Satanico Pandemonium isn't only exploitation, it belongs to a genre called ""nunsploitation."" The place is Spain and the time is most likely pre-1834. Sister Maria (Cecilia Pezet) is a devoted nun who finds herself visited by visions of Satan, or Luzbel. The devil appears as a man to Sister Maria, and using obvious Biblical symbolism, tends to carry a bitten-into apple. Sister Maria is startled and horrified by the series of temptations that happen to her via the film's faulty special effects. As another user has pointed out, this is an obsession scenario by an external devil.<br /><br />One important observation should be stated. The actress playing Sister Maria is very beautiful with warm, bedroom eyes, and many of us (meaning men) wouldn't mind watching her getting robbed of her virtue - as well as tormented by particular sins. But what happens is with a little influence from Beelzebub, Sister Maria soon indulges in lesbianism, child seduction and heresy. The film has a church-like quality to the way it moves slowly and harps upon moments of less-than-dramatic value, and with its fantastic logic, Sister Maria turns into hell in a headdress. One scene in particular is actually quite disturbing, with Sister Maria covering her naked, bloody body with her uniform.<br /><br />The flick isn't entirely baldfaced exploitation though, with interesting questions about faith in the dialogue. That aside, the flick's appeal seems rather obvious. In life, most of us want what we cannot have, and the fantasy of despoiling such a person (i.e., a nun) can be very powerful. Satanico Pandemonium uses its subject matter effectively, and despite an unsatisfying story resolution, it packs quite a wallop.",unsup
10210_0,"Laura returns with her family to the orphanage she grew up in as a child, she reopens it for handicapped children and all is going to plan until her son starts communicating with an invisible friend.......<br /><br />Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona & produced by Guillermo del Toro, this Spanish picture is a delightful antidote to the ream of gore for gore sake movies flooding the market on a seemingly daily basis. This is not a horror movie as such, this is one of those pictures that oozes old fashioned values as regards telling a grand old ghost story with mysterious undertones. The setting is perfect, the orphanage of the piece is a ghostly monolithic structure that has all those perfectly shadowy rooms that are hiding secrets, expansive gardens perfectly framed in aura by Bayona's willingness to let the setting be an integral part of the story. The story is a creepy one, and there is always an added air of unease when children are the focal point of the piece in question, and sure enough this central concept of troubled children and troubled childhoods gets the maximum amount of emotion from the viewing public.<br /><br />It's hard to write anymore than I have without delving deeper into the story and it's significant turn of events, suffice to say I feel this is a wonderful creepy, and at times beautiful, film that prospective viewers would be better off going into devoid of any prior knowledge. Belén Rueda plays Laura and it's a marvellous performance from her, full of emotion and guts, she carries the film with skillful ease. Bayona directs carefully, and it's evident that he is benefiting from the guiding hands of his gifted producer, but his marker is here and I'll be keeping an eye out for future efforts from the young Spaniard.<br /><br />A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting & Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you, get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure. 9/10",unsup

A great suspense film I recommend.

10212_0,"Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to the orphanage she spent time in as a child with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and little boy Simon (Roger Princep) in hopes of re-establishing it as seaside retreat for children with disabilities only to find there may be some former residents who never left. In Juan Antonio Bayona's tightly wound ""The Orphanage"" nothing is as it seems and child's play takes on sinister overtones.<br /><br />Bayona belongs to this new wave of Spanish-language directors (most notably Del Torro and Amenabar) who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones. Whereas ""Pan's Labyrinth"" took a dark fantasy approach to a Passion Play, ""The Orphanage"" is closer to the classic haunted house themes of ""The Others"" as it attempts to give a sentimental view of life after death. Be warned, ""The Orphanage"" is often more sad than scary, and those not familiar with Catholic mysticism might find things a bit hard to believe. As goes the film's mantra...Believe, Then You Will See. Those with the patience and the heart will be greatly rewarded as the audience doesn't necessarily have to Believe to relate to the characters who do.<br /><br />Working from refined ""less is more"" psychological horror templates, Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. There will be a simplistic but heartfelt exploration of grief. There will be allusions to classic literature (in this case a very nicely done ""Peter Pan"" as Catholic allegory motif). There will be uncovering dark secrets from the past. There will be precocious children with spooky imaginary friends. There will be creaking set designs and manipulative sound effects to create ""gotcha!"" moments. There will be a creepy medium (an excellent Geraldine Chaplin) brought in for a séance. And there will be a twist at the end.<br /><br />Thankfully, there is also a great performance from Belen Rueda as Laura. She gives a compelling portrayal of a woman devoured by her loss and achingly desperate for the truth no matter how horrific that truth might be. One must have a cold heart not to find sympathy with her, and even the most hardened audience member will find it hard not to feel that stray tear form in the corner of their trembling eye when all is revealed. ""The Orphanage"" offers nothing terribly new, but sometimes the same old ghost story presented in a beautiful way makes for the best type of cold-rainy-day entertainment.",unsup
10213_0,"I went into a screening of this today knowing only that it was about a woman who buys the home she lived in as an orphaned child, planning to open it to other orphans, that it mixed fantasy and reality, and that Guillermo del Toro of 'Pan's Labyrinth' had a hand in it. I didn't have any expectations. Even if I did, I certainly not have expected what I got. 'El Orfanato' surprised me first in successfully thrilling me with its surface, and surprised me again in how deeply it moved me with its core.<br /><br />When Laura (the marvelous Belén Rueda) moves back into the house that used to be the orphanage she lived in as a girl, she is thirty-seven, married, and she and her husband have adopted a son - Simón, a little boy with HIV who doesn't know that he's terminally ill or adopted. Simón is wildly creative - he has several imaginary friends and a penchant for treasure hunts, mind games, and the story of Peter Pan. One day shortly after a mysterious visit from a social worker and Simón's revelation that he knows the truth about his adoption and illness, Simón disappears. The rest of the film follows Laura's desperate search for her son as she comes to terms with her loss and her own past as well.<br /><br />Screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez does a masterful job of balancing the thriller with the drama. Laura's attempts to connect with everything that haunts her and her home are darkly touching, though slightly psychologically twisted. The acting is strong, and the directing, editing, cinematography, and music all work together well. Some of the sound effects - the constant creaking, wind blowing, etc. - got wearisome as the film went on, and some of the thrills were a little cheap - I won't ruin it for anyone by revealing them - though, admittedly, they were effective all the same. The story dragged a little towards the end and during the scene with the medium - cutting it just a little shorter might have been equally as effective and easier on the viewer.<br /><br />Bottom line: even if you don't like ""scary"" movies (like me), you'll probably still appreciate and enjoy the more thrilling aspects. If you're a horror flick buff, you'll probably find some of the thriller elements a little tired and overdone. Either way, it's still worth seeing - the exploration of Laura's heart and mind are both lovely and tragic to behold, and though the film is morbid, it is beautiful as well.",unsup

The Orphanage is the first film from director Juan Antonio Bayona and was produced by his long-time friend Guillermo Del Toro, director of my film of last year, Pan's Labyrinth.<br /><br />The Orphanage tells the story of Laura who returns to the abandoned orphanage where she was raised in order to re-open it as a home for children with disabilities. Along with her husband and adopted son Simon who is HIV Positive, she prepares the orphanage to receive its new residents but all is not as it seems, and steadily the sins of the past begin to resurface through a series of ghostly happenings.<br /><br />A solid old-fashioned ghost story that is genuinely frightening without resorting to lashings of gore or cheap shocks, The Orphanage is the best horror film of 2007 so far and certainly shows Hollywood the true definition of suspense after the laughable '1408'.

10216_0,"Bone chilling terrors with a hint of the fantastic await audiences who dare to enter The Orphanage. Produced by Guillermo Del Toro, The Orphanage continues the tradition the filmmaker started with films like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, by showing the darker sides of humanity through frightening fantasies. In many ways Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona has applied Del Toro's own winning formula to The Orphanage and has made the most flawless film of this lineage.<br /><br />Moving back to the orphanage where she grew up, Laura and her husband Carlos plan to reopen the property as a home for mentally handicapped children. The gorgeous old house seems too good to be true, and it is. Her son Simon starts telling his parents of an ""imaginary"" friend, Tomas. Ignoring Simon's claims as merely childhood banter, the parents continue in their work, readying the house. Supernatural disturbances and a maniacal old woman start to disturb the family, resulting in the sudden and traumatic disappearance of Simon. Desperate and panicked, both Laura and Carlos must look within themselves, and confront the beings that haunt the orphanage, if they are ever to see their son again.<br /><br />A commentary on faith and love, Bayona uses the thrills and troubling chills of The Orphanage to create a powerful message. Using the disappearance of Simon as the catalyst for showing the devotion of a mother's love, Laura plays a stark contrast to her husband's practical interpretation of their harrowing situation. While Carlos would rather believe that there is a logical answer to unlocking this mystery, Laura explores more otherworldly options.<br /><br />Her knowledge of the orphanage and the solitary pain that her missing child must be going through makes her a prime vessel to confront the ghastly creatures from beyond, and answer the dark questions that De Toro and Bayona dare to ask. Like last year's Oscar front runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Bayona mixes a bit of the fantastical into The Orphanage. Allusions to legendary fables, such as the overt Peter Pan reference, combined with the staple fantasy images, help The Orphanage rise above the average horror romp.<br /><br />With only the faintest bit of gore, The Orphanage accomplishes its scares methodically, using the somber atmosphere to give audiences goosebumps. The creaky old mansion appears far more menacing at night, and Bayona makes use of incredible sound mixing to keep viewers on edge as the protagonist explores the dark unknown.<br /><br />Pairing the producer's innate knowledge of the cinematic language of horror with the raw and untested talents of a first time director paid off brilliantly. There is a sense of restraint when it comes to the scares in The Orphanage that many veteran filmmakers have failed to approach. Bayona lets the frights build subconsciously, making each one far more effective when unleashed. In fact, few cinematic moments rival The Orphanage for sheer terror as when Laura turns to a group of ghost hunters to help solve their specter problem.<br /><br />Helping to increase the tense atmosphere is stellar production design and gorgeous cinematography. While there may be no fauns or pale men lurking in The Orphanage, the design of Tomas alone is sure to give off its fair share of shivers. Belen Rueda is equally stunning in her performance as Laura. The actress lends credibility to the phantasmagorical happenings, capturing our sympathy as a fully rounded character. We follow her as a mother and a victim, and we can only pray that her faith will reunite her with Simon.<br /><br />Heading to American shores nearly one year after the stunning domestic success of Pan's Labyrinth, The Orphanage should appeal to an equally wide audience. While longtime, art house, Del Toro fiends will certainly be please with the dramatic arc of the picture, the strong horror element and shocking ending should make the film easily translatable for all viewers, despite the language barrier. One thing is for sure, with The Orphanage we have adopted another truly talented Spanish filmmaker, and Juan Antonio Bayona is a director to watch.<br /><br />-Joe Russo",unsup
10217_0,"The Orphanage is a slick and quietly chilling piece of work based around (what else?) an orphanage. A woman named Laura returns to the orphanage she grew up in as a child, with the intention of opening it up again as a home for children with disabilities. Together with her husband and adopted son Simon, Laura tries to make the huge old building ready to receive it's first new residents, but all is not quiet in the dusty rooms and grounds, and gradually she starts to feel sinister presences from the past making themselves known.<br /><br />The film strings out quite a good story, blending traditional scares (bumping noises heard through walls and doors, silently appearing children in masks) with modern touches (Simon is HIV positive). Although most of the actual frights are on the soft side, the film does have quite away with sudden shocks, especially one great sequence involving the death of a sinister secondary character...you'll know when you see it! But mostly, things stay pretty calm, and there were times when I was wishing for something more visceral to actually happen, as many of the very well built tension sequences fade away without any cinematic pay-off, such as a very tense séance sequence, and in most of the (many) scenes of Laura alone in the orphanage, she being almost too subtly menaced for things to get really scary, which I think is a shame. However there are certain moments when you WILL jump!<br /><br />However, The Orphanage still stands up as a strong piece of work. The backbone of the film is undoubtedly the strong performance by Belén Rueda as Laura, who carries the entire film admirably. The film looks great, with stunning photography and very elegant sets and a gorgeous building standing in for the orphanage itself. Sound and music work very well too, and the film succeeds in working many small elements together (such as a playground hiding game and some very clever revelations towards the end), so all in all, the film is an accomplished piece of cinema and well worth seeing, although don't expect too much real terror as most of the chills in this film are poetic rather than gruesome.",unsup

Despite the obvious low-budget, the quality of the cinematography (including its color scheme and the moody lighting) is very adequate - if not exactly smooth! The score, too, is notable in its schizophrenia: lively pop and electronic sounds (as in the rather silly orgy at the end, in which some of the bawdy nuns were actually played by prostitutes hired expressly for this one scene!) alternating with pastoral/lyrical sections and the occasional reverent passage inside the convent.<br /><br />The film, unfortunately, badly lacks pace and several shots run longer than is necessary - apart from it being somewhat repetitive (particularly during the possessed nun's sex-and-death rampage and her subsequent attempts to cover her tracks, which scenes may have influenced the first half of THE ANTICHRIST [1974]; SATANICO PANDEMONIUM itself was partly inspired by Matthew Lewis' celebrated novel THE MONK - which Luis Bunuel, friend of the director and my personal favorite film-maker, adapted for the screen {but didn't direct} around this same time...and which I managed to catch while in Hollywood early last January!) It is, however, galvanized by an exceptional leading performance from the statuesque (and Keira Knightley look-alike!) Cecilia Pezet.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the film faced censorship problems with its seduction (and later sex) scenes involving a nun and an under-aged shepherd boy!; his subsequent murder at her hands, however, is extremely unconvincing. Like ALUCARDA, the film doesn't dwell on period reconstruction (and, in fact, we only realize when the story actually takes place via a reference towards the end to the Inquisition); still, a few social/racial issues are raised nonetheless with the presence of the two black nuns/maids, who are mistreated even by their white 'colleagues'!<br /><br />One of its most interesting - and audacious - concepts is the way the film subverts its own intentions by pasting four endings to the narrative back-to-back: a) the girl renounces her sins and is about to allow herself to be captured by her fellow nuns; b) the Devil (campily coiffured and given to elementary conjuring tricks, but aptly incarnated by the handsome Enrique Rocha - who, at one point, even manifests himself to Pezet in the guise of a lesbian nun!) re-appearing to offer her the post of Mother Superior at the convent (the girl having conveniently murdered the current one), whereupon she discovers that her colleagues have been possessed as well, though they still end up killing her!; c) the whole story is revealed to have been merely the delusional fantasy of the main character, under shadow of death from the plague!!; and d) the devil is, however, seen to be all too real and has already set his sights on a new 'victim' at the convent.",unsup

Of course, given their violent carefree tendencies, they would logically just go rob some other business. Instead, they stay and willingly work a crappy service sector job that most people don't want.<br /><br />Their staying there is mostly a vehicle to provide encounters with obnoxious customers, à la Clerks, but any comedic value in these is squandered.<br /><br />The biggest flaw would be the characters. The protagonists are just violent and obnoxious thugs with no charisma whatsoever. The growing group of hostages consists of one-dimensional whimpering crybabies, which wears thin very fast. There isn't a single likable person among the whole cast.<br /><br />After 45 minutes of pointless slapstick with nary a funny occurrence, the film takes a wild stab at character development, showing why these thugs are the way they are. But it's all very shallow and perfunctory.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are also severely wanting. The camera-work is rough and jarring, the editing is mess and the lighting (or lack of it) is a disaster.<br /><br />The ""comedy"" is repetitive and unfunny, the cast is totally unlikeable and the whole movie is an aimless mess.

10226_0,"This one brought back some unfunny memories (which I thought I'd share, though they have absolutely nothing, really, to do with this movie). I was working in a gas station, late one night, when a pair of would-be robbers tried to get the drop on me. I had a .38 on me and managed to get the drop on them, instead. They fled. About a month later, they returned, during the day, and robbed me at gunpoint in front of literally dozens of witnesses. The company for which I worked promptly fired me. ""Standard operating procedure,"" they lied. (An assistant manager would get robbed twice in the following months and the gas station would eventually close down... but said assman never got canned.) I laughed my butt off when I saw ATTACK THE GAS STATION! I highly recommend it.",unsup

10229_0,"On the surface, this tale of a brutal gang who rob a gas station (hence the name!) and take the workers hostage appears to be just another been-there, seen-that Asian thriller, but underneath there's a soft centre waiting to be discovered - short vignettes give us clues as to how these thugs came to be this way, one of the hostages learns to stand up for himself, characters who are even nastier than the robbers end up worst off, and even the thugs themselves get a shot a redemption. OK, it's not especially profound, and like so many Asian films, it suffers from an inconsistency of tone (lashings of violence, swearing, slapstick comedy and musical numbers make for a strange mix) which might alienate some western viewers, but it's fast-moving, never boring, surprising in all the right places and a definite recommendation for a fun evening's viewing.",unsup
1022_0,"Even though I have ambiguous estimations about this film on the whole, I can only say for sure that ""Satanico Pandemonium"" is a must-see nunsploitation Mexican flick for anyone who can be pleased about these kinds of movies for their evident ridiculousness. This is one of those flicks that have too many flaws and no plot whatsoever but it's still impossible not to like them, for some imprecise cause. The acting is not exactly Academy Award material and it causes unintended laughter. The special effects in which we see the concept of Satan and temptation itself represented on a laughable guy naked, is by far one of the most hysterical things about this film, along with the outrageously shabby sound effects during these strange apparitions. The whole thing just looks too tacky and the look on the guy's face is simply priceless, so how can anyone not love it?. I know some people could take it as a reason to overthrow the director's gracious effort, but I myself, found it too silly not to like it. Without offering an actual share of real horror, ""Satanico Pandemonium"" manages to get the attention, even if it is by some means erroneously advertised. There are some noble allocations of gore here and there, but the film mostly focuses on the drama and eroticism. The first half an hour happens to be ineffective in a way and that would be the only reasons why I felt compelled to turn it off throughout the first minutes and leave it incomplete. It contains no dialogs, no action and for the most part only a nice display of beautiful Mexican landscapes, which is not exactly enough to make it endurable. However, it is only a matter of persistence to realize that after the big unnecessary moments of silence and boredom, the story starts to develop some of the most astonishing states of affairs, in which we see lesbian soft-core sex between two nuns, a nun taking advantage of a teenage boy and some enjoyable bloody murders inside the convent. Without anything else to add, I can only recommend ""Satánico Pandemonium"" to anyone who is in the mood for a decent nunsploitation drama, with some utterly random sexual scenes, a couple of nice murders to attach at least a small share of horror to the story, a badly placed background story of racism and of course...lots of sexy and sinful nuns.",unsup

The last gas station attack becomes much more involved and lasts an entire evening, during which the gas station attackers and their hostages all learn valuable life lessons from each other and grow as people.

10232_0,"To make a memorable mark in the comedy genre nowadays is quite a difficult thing to do. With movies that recycle the same tasteless toilet humour and clichéd teenage sex antics, comedy is a genre that has slowly been dying in the mainstream for the last decade. Korean comedy veteran Sang-Jin Kim's Attack the Gas Station is a hysterically different take on comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, but comes through with some seriously entertaining comedy. Before seeing this film for the first time I didn't expect much, from the title and all, but I was very surprised on the humour and direction of Attack the Gas Station.<br /><br />Attack the Gas Station is the wacky story of a ""gang"" of 4 Korean youths who have a bad case of boredom, so what better to do then rob the local gas station?! After the high of the robbery wears off, the 4 teenagers find themselves right where they were before the robbery, bored. The only solution they can come up with is to rob the gas station again! As the gang attends to the customers to keep all quiet, they realize that instead of just robbing the place, they can make even more money by keeping the money that the patrons give them for pumping their gas! Soon after, a group of high school wannabe thugs come to collect money from one of the gas station employees. After rubbing the robbers the wrong way, our main gang decide to teach the wannabes a lesson, and take them hostage too! Somewhere along the line, their antics lead them to taking a snotty pre-madonna hostage, who's boyfriend just happens to be in the yakuza, and pissing off a highly irritable delivery boy who decides that he isn't going to take it anymore! Aside from the hilarious action that takes place, the film has a nice underlying tone of the gang comically bonding with the now supportive gas station employees as they teach each other to stand up for what they believe in and cooperate to take down what soon will be slew of opposing gangs waging war on the gas station! Attack the Gas Station does not have any big name actors, no recognizable faces, but the acting is enjoyable. Sang-Jin Kim is known for his knack of directing new talent. The feel of the movie is real enough, given the crazy premise, and the ride you go on with the cast is highly enjoyable, and incredibly funny.<br /><br />You wouldn't see Attack the Gas Station winning any Oscars or sweeping any film festivals, because that's not the aim of this film. Attack the Gas Station is a semi-serious comical ride of what some slightly confused youth do when they're bored, and nothing more. There is no camera art and no first grade performances, but I doubt that is what anyone going into this film expects. From the opening you understand what level to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />Attack the Gas Station is a refreshing take on comedy that finds a very original and comical way to entertain its audience, while not wasting their time. Its pace is swift and fluid. From a very comical opening to a final parking lot battle between our new found ""heroes,"" some very scared high schoolers, the yakuza, and a group of angst filled delivery boys, Attack the Gas Station is a spin on comedy that shouldn't be passed up.",unsup
10233_0,"**SPOILER ALERT** <br /><br />I don't know if ATTACK THE GAS STATION holds up to repeat viewings, but it's terrific fun once, at least. An adrenalized, ultra-stylized, comic-book-violent black comedy about a group of well-scrubbed but very alienated youth who rob a gas station out of boredom, before then deciding to return and run the place for a night, pocketing all of the sales, and then taking off. Of course, the plan goes a little awry...<br /><br />The style is a deadpan blend of Kubrick, Tarantino, Peckinpah and maybe Suzuki, played for all the gleeful nasty humor and actually sharp social critique that can be gotten out of the premise; at the very least, this film energetically puts the 'slap' back into slapstick. A Peckinpah quote/homage becomes a running punch line, which as much as anything sums up the sensibility. The way, way over-the-top climax is quite well-orchestrated.<br /><br />Tokyo Shock DVD is of good quality, not many extras (making-of featurette), though I don't know if this one really needs 'em.",unsup

10236_0,"""Attack the Gas Station!"" is not only the most entertaining film Korea has produced during it's recent industry boom, but one of the most fun, tongue in cheek, genre-aware action/comedies from anywhere since heck knows when. Serving as both a parody of siege/hostage films and a camp action extravaganza in it's own right, ATGS moves at breakneck speed, leaving not a dull moment as the quartet of luckless youths try to avoid detection and learn running a gas station isn't as easy as it seems.<br /><br />Despite feeling like an effective throwback to American cult B cinema of the 1970s and 80s - namely the works of Walter Hill and John Carpenter, ATGS also has such a refreshing, contemporary feeling and a razor sharp sense of humour that I can't think how the film can possibly get boring or how anyone could not enjoy it.<br /><br />If I had to watch one film on a loop for the rest of my life, this would be a strong contender. By the time the end credits rolled (and they came VERY quickly), I wanted to watch the film again, and again. There isn't anything bad I can say about ATGS, and my words cannot do it justice. I can't remember the last time I was this entertained by a film. If ""Attack the Gas Station!"" doesn't restore your faith in cinema, and the human race in general, I can't think what will.",unsup
10237_0,"This is an odd little Korean film about 4 slacker-types who rob a gas station, and come back to rob it a second time. When they're mistaken for the attendants they realize that they'll do better by taking OVER the gas station and collecting the money. As time passes (this all takes place in one night) they amass a roomful of hostages that they've taken, all guarded by Bulldog, a not-too-bright lad with a floppy hat and a big stick. This says a lot about Korea, I guess, in that most people don't want a full tank of gas because it's so expensive, and a few other things that flicker by that indicate that the economy isn't exactly booming. Some of the comedy to this is pretty standard but there are some touches that put this above most action/comedies. There are flashbacks to failures of the 4 young men that show the frustrations that got them where they are at the time they decided take matters into their own hands. There is dumb humor in this but there's also some sly and dark humor thrown in here & there which redeems it. Overall I found this to be an amusing film but still it's a touch on the ""light"" side, a little more black humor could have made it a bit better.",unsup

1023_0,"One of the most faithful nuns in her convent, Sister Maria finds herself obsessed by the Devil. Obsessed, not possessed, because Satan is an external force in this film. A strapping and vampiric lad, the Devil brings out Sister Maria's inner desires for both sex and blood. Plagued also by her devotion to God, she tries to fight these forbidden desires and lusts with prayer and penitence only to have them come back ten fold. Sister Maria is suddenly caught between Satanic submission or death.<br /><br />Satanico Pandemonium is a good nunsploitation effort in the vein of, the more celebrated, Juan Lopez Moctezuma'a Alucarda. It has sex, nudity, lesbianism, child seduction, self mutilation, blood, and death(not necessarily in that order, of course). The ending is clever and surprising following a bloody and ravenous climax. If you're a fan of nunsploitation and offbeat cinema, do yourself a favor and check out Satanico Pandemonium. You won't regret it.",unsup
10240_0,"Attack the Gas Station! is an effective show case for 4 young stars and goes some way to prove that the newly revitalised Korean cinema has a lot to offer. Anarchic, briskly staged and with some genuinely funny moments, it is a film which could be remade to good effect in the West (I can see Kevin Spacey as the beleagued station owner, for instance) although I doubt that all of the verve could be recaptured, for this is a young man's film, angry and alert to wider issues.<br /><br />""If they move, kill them"" is a running joke through the film as the number of hostages increases and, whether or not a deliberate reference to Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, its still funny. <br /><br />The least convincing aspect of the film is the flashbacks. While useful in providing some background and character motivation for the main characters, their previous lives seems sketched in too cursorily and in result the young men lose dramatic weight. It's as if that, once away from the scene of their most important and direct influence, they are morally enervated. Their stature is only significant, the film seems to suggest, as the principals go on and take direct, group action. Part of this is deliberate, as their past frustration undoubtedly feeds their current boredom and anger, yet one feels that much of the same ground could have been covered by some relevant interaction between the four, who leave their personal demons resolutely undiscussed.<br /><br />More interesting is what the Gas Station represents: this viewer feels that, to some extent, it is Korea in microcosm. Just as Japanese cinema has repeatedly reworked the trauma of nuclear holocaust into its science fiction and fantasy films, so the peculiar nature of the local North-South Korean standoff and mutual hostility is echoed in this film, in which the ending threatens a peculiarly lunatic and mutually achieved apocalypse through petrol and lighters. Clearly, continued tension plays a part in the national psyche, and the repeated requests to 'fix it'(the phone) has wider implications as far as national communication or understanding is concerned.<br /><br />The contempt poured upon the glib national slogans hanging in the wall is one explicit political disaffection. As the film proceeds and the shiny new gas station (a manifestation in itself of the hitherto 'economic miracle' of the east) is increasingly the scene of mini power struggles, escalating standoffs, and threats of destruction. This is a Korea in which changes are demanded, or annihilation surely follows, and in which no one it appears wants to be 'boss' or take responsibility, as the station owner's ready relinquishment of authority suggests. A country in which one might as well balance upside down on one's head, pointlessly and endlessly, as achieve any dialogue. And as the final scene shows, a forecourt packed with Koreans ready to destroy themselves is both bitterly ironic and ruthlessly apt.",unsup

10242_0,"Although the tagline of Attack The Gas Station (1999) is `Just when you wanted to laugh, here they come,' it might as well have been `Idle hands are the devil's playthings.' In ATGS, the third and most successful film from Korean director Sang-Jin Kim, four young Korean punks, well, attack a gas station obviously (twice, the same station both times), because they are bored. As they realize running the station for an evening might be more profitable than simply robbing it, they end up taking hostage the manager and employees as well as most of the customers. On the surface, ATGS is a black comedy with a great cast, but in the end is also a wonderful examination of group dynamics. The group is lead by Sung-jae Lee, who plays No Mark. He is the most conservative looking of the four, with short, military style hair, and relatively normal clothing. He is also one of the easiest ways to recommend this movie, as he totally dominates the screen whenever he is in it, to the point where it is completely believable that he intimidates two armed police officers in their squad car as he chases them down with a moped. Oh-seong Yu plays Bulldozer, who is in charge of the hostages and swaggers around menacing people with a hockey stick. He gets less screen-time than the other three, stuck as he is in a back room with his prisoners, but is always impressive as he is shown controlling the ever growing crowd. Seong-jin Kang, who plays Ddan Dda-ra (a failed musician) and Ji-tae Yu, who plays Paint (a failed painter who likes to create nudes, then throw paint across them and shout `I'm a genius!'), are fun to watch and are more punkish, but are overshadowed by both No Mark and Bulldozer. Even considering that, all four give outstanding performances and are consistently entertaining to watch. It is as they take more and more hostages that ATGS becomes really interesting. It just seems impossible that one man, Bulldozer, even armed with a big club, can control a group of twenty plus hostages. They even ask him about this. `What would you do if a group attacked you?' to which he replies [this is an approximation] `I would pick just one. I would ignore all of the others and just beat up that one guy, no matter what. It's happened to me once. Four guys attacked me. I sent one to the hospital. Me? A couple of bruises.' As he relates his story, the hostages shrink away from him. But the hostages are not controlled simply through intimidation. Bulldozer punishes them by making them do handstands. Ddan Dda-ra makes four rival gang members sing as he and his friends eat. No Mark forces the manager to fix a broken phone, but keeps smashing it after it's been fixed (after which he yells `Fix it!'). And of course, they get the hostages to control each other. They encourage the employees to browbeat the manager. Bulldozer instigates a fight between one of the employees, a heavyset high-school kid, and a gang member who's been bullying him. After the kid easily beats up the gangster, Bulldozer makes him his number two man, even leaving him in charge of the hostages as Bulldozer goes to eat with No Mark, Ddan Dda-ra and Paint. It is these group dynamics that are perhaps the most fascinating aspect of ATGS, as we watch No Mark and his gang utterly dictates situations that seem at first totally out of control. On a personal note, I'm very glad guns are almost totally non-existent in ATGS (only the cops have them). The movie leaves no doubt whatsoever that the gang are bad-asses. It shows them beating up groups twice their size. As mentioned, No Mark is able to push around two armed police officers. But it's a bad-assness based entirely on their personal abilities. They push people around because they can, not because some gun gives them that power. If No Mark and the others had used guns, it would have been the gun that was controlling the hostages, not them. Using guns would have made ATGS much more serious and disturbing, when it is mostly satirical and relatively light-hearted. The absence of guns lets us like No Mark, Bulldozer, Paint and Ddan Dda-ra, who are criminals, but not villains. Yes, they rob a gas station (twice) and beat up a bunch of people, but their threats mostly end with a mild pummeling. With a gun, the only alternative from shooting someone in a horrible but non-lethal manner is to kill them. Without that ever present threat of death, Attack the Gas Station can provoke a chuckle as these four young men get away with (metaphorically speaking) murder.",unsup

10245_0,"""Rien à faire"" is a watchable and enjoyable flick for one main reason. Marion Vernoux, the director had intuition by choosing Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi for the main role. It is a real joy to see fer acting on the screen and her big talent, her soft voice are widely sufficient to justify the vision of this film. It is all the more beneficial as she's ably assisted by her main partner Patrick Dell'Isola.<br /><br />Marion Vernoux put very well in parallel her two main actors' living conditions. The contrast constitutes one of her best weapons between the naive and the simple-minded Marie and Pierre who appears as a lucid and clever man. This contrast is highlighted when the director evokes difference and misunderstanding about several points commented by the two characters. Another interesting detail: the supermarket plays the role of meeting between the two universes.<br /><br />Then, the author built her movie around one of the biggest plagues at the end of the twentieth century: unemployment. So, you could expect to discover a bleak and hopeless atmosphere. It is not the case. The relative seriousness of the situation remains confined in the background. A certain joy of living comes out of the film. Marie and Pierre are jobless but while searching for a job, they take time to know themselves, to help each other and eventually to fall in love. Marion Vernoux lets us suggest the reasons why they become lovers. You feel that Marie gets on rather badly with her husband (Sergi Lopez). As for Pierre, he falls in love with Marie, mainly because he doesn't succeed in finding a job again.<br /><br />However, this work isn't without a few faults. Certain sequences can be judged as conventional (like the one when Pierre explains to Marie why he wants to put an end to their love affair) and I think an extra touch of passion would have given the movie more strength.<br /><br />Anyway, I repeat it: this movie is worth watching especially for Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi and given the treatment Marion Vernoux made of her subject, her work can be taken for a cousin of the movie: ""en avoir ou pas..."" (1995) by Laetitia Masson.",unsup

10247_0,"I noticed that the overall IMDb rating for this film was a lowly 3.2. This seems a bit unfair. The story is good, not great, and may at times be bit predictable. But the acting is quite good with a very sympathetic performance by Tom Skerritt. Robert Davi shows a warm side in much contrast to the ""heavy"" he played in a James Bond Film. Wendy Hughes couldn't have been more cold and calculating in much contrast to the warm and loving character she played opposite Peter Falk in ""Happy New Year"" or the playful character she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in ""The Heist."" Lastly, Zalman King as a filmmaker has tried to elevate the adult genre to an art form. If not familiar, try to see his most successful series: ""Red Shoes Diaries."" Sometimes you can catch an episode on late night Showtime.<br /><br />It might be said that not every film is meant to be ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""Citizen Kane."" There's nothing wrong about a shoot-em-up western where the gunfighters never seem to run out of bullets. And although ""The Fast and the Furious"" may never make IMDb's top 250 list, it was a good enough film for the producers to make two sequels.<br /><br />It's all about entertainment and since the world's population is so diverse, we all like different types of movies. One could guess that some viewers who are offended by nudity may have been ""turned off"" by this film, which also may account for the low 3.2 rating. But the film is worth a watch.<br /><br />Finally, Nina Siemaszko is excellent in this film. She brings across her vulnerability, frustration, disappointment, etc. Her performance must have been good, because other producers noticed and she had a nice supporting role in ""The American President"" and a recurring role for 3 or 4 years on ""The West Wing."" On a personal note, I would urge all of us to respect the IMDb and the lengths they go to provide this forum. Let's give fair comments to all films we view.

10248_0,"The story is about a beautiful young girl, Blue (Nina Siemaszko), who is approaching sexual maturity. In order to achieve a happy and fulfilling life she must avoid being corrupted and enslaved by sexual desire and lust, and ultimately find true love. But this is no easy matter in the cold, cruel world in which she suddenly finds herself virtually alone and defenseless. She becomes the unwilling victim of power hungry individuals who seek to exploit her as a prostitute. With help from more compassionate and understanding people, Blue struggles to maintain dignity and courage in her desperate commitment to be free.<br /><br />While its true that the film has little connection with its predecessor ""Wild Orchid"", its main flaw seems to be that its just a little too cliché and at times hard to believe. This shortcoming is difficult to avoid, however, in most any book or film. To Zalman King's credit, the final outcome and the essential theme are not completely obvious from the very beginning. The exotic setting in the past also helps give the film a sense of novelty.<br /><br />While the movie does have numerous sexually explicit scenes, which may offend some people, it exhibits far less voyeurism and wanton sexual intercourse that are typical of so called ""soft-porn"" movies. Whereas, I found Nina Siemaszko's natural beauty to be a refreshing change from the irritating plastic-boob floozies that are the main attraction of the aforementioned genre. Moreover, Wild Orchid 2 is a far more compelling human drama than stories about men from out of space who want to learn what love is, but seem to only be interested in sex. A rating of 2.8 hardly does this film any justice. I myself was quite found of the movie, and consider it worth viewing by those seek more tragic and melancholy overtones than what you may find in a typical romance.<br /><br />Nina Siemaszko portrays of young ""virgin"", who is lonely, innocent and vulnerable, yet strong willed and independent, with higher moral values. She acted well enough to earn my sympathy, and I found myself routing for her throughout the film. Through Blue's trying experiences, we learn that in order to find true love we must be bold and determined, we must exhibit self-sacrifice and compassion, and, above all, we must look beyond outward appearances and fallacies, and seek the inner beauty that lies within ourselves and others we meet.",unsup
10249_0,"Zalman King is an actor and scriptwriter who expanded his capabilities in mid career to include both producing & directing (more recently he has also very successfully tried his hand at cinematography, to complete what today has become a rare fivefold). In 1986 the success of the strongly erotic film '9 1/2 weeks', for which he was both a co-writer and the producer, drew a great deal of attention and gave him a chance to build a reputation as the best known North American Producer/Director of erotic films.

Its claim to be a true erotic film became widely accepted - largely on the strength of its last very intense love making scene between Carre Otis and Mickey Rourke. (They were married soon afterwards, and background publicity fostering an unlikely rumour that this scene was not simulated probably helped this) Two years later came 'Wild Orchid 2 - Two Shades of Blue', released in 1989. This featured another original film-script written by Zalman King, and its name was not derived from any previous literary or dramatic work, but was clearly intended to exploit the reputation which WO-1 had earned - no doubt its sub-title was also selected with the same objective. It has only achieved a relatively low approval rating from IMDb users, however as far as I am concerned it is a fine work that, despite some flaws, is the nearest approach to a true erotic film with which Zalman King has so far been associated.<br /><br />Unfortunately most of his more recent works have been directed more towards television presentation than to the cinema and do not provide a lot of competition. His company has created two different sets of short films for television both comprising independent episodes based on a longer feature film that provides a more detailed background for the complete series. The best known of these is probably the Red Shoes Diaries series. It started with a 1992 feature film of the same name which explained the significance of both the red shoes and the diaries. This has spawned an ongoing series of about fifty short TV episodes that have been continuing ever since. The very similar Chromium Blue series featured fantasies associated with the visit of a billionaire's private cruise ship to various exotic Mediterranean resorts, and probably had a higher unit budget. For me, most episodes from both these series were partly spoiled by the use of cinematographic techniques that are usually regarded as associated more with music videos than with the cinema; in addition their short running times makes it difficult for them to convey any meaningful message.<br /><br />Unlike these later short productions, Wild Orchid 2 succeeds in involving the viewer in a story that is sufficiently disturbing to provide genuine emotional impact. The film is best described as a movie equivalent of the 'bodice ripper' paperback romances which appeal most strongly to the fair sex but men often also enjoy, and when televised they provide ideal entertainment for a couple. For me Wild Orchid 2 remains far the best of the many works with which Zalman King has been associated. Although the story is rather far fetched the film has an excellent cast and is very well acted, so most of its viewers probably enjoy it. (Some IMDb users have criticised the acting of its star, Nina Siemaszko, but this performance successfully established the foundations for her very productive acting career which has covered numerous TV productions as well as significant feature films - so enough said). The films ending is rather prolonged and is also somewhat weak, this is particularly noticeable because of the strong meat which preceded it, but Zalman King does deserve credit for ensuring that it was not made glaringly obvious long in advance. Watching it, I wished at times that he had had the training as a cinematographer which Russ Meyer received in the U.S. army. The modern cine camera is a technological marvel, capable of providing clear easily viewed images of even the most complex scenes. Unduly short sequences handicapped by excessive or inadequate contrast are used today by too many directors when attempting to create atmosphere or mood; ignoring the fact that this mood can be irretrievably lost once the audience starts wondering what they missed in the lost parts of the screen image. Despite these criticisms, Wild Orchid 2 is a fine film which successfully captured the trauma faced by a young girl being reluctantly but irretrievably drawn into a life of prostitution, whilst lacking the courage to break away and face the world on her own. It provides viewers with much more 'meat' than any of King's other recent films (except perhaps for his own performance in St Francis - another noteworthy film, but a serious study of the drug culture rather than an erotic work.) <br /><br />I believe WO-2 deserves a far higher rating than it has currently been given by IMDb users, this rating seems to be the victim of what appears to have become a double standard, the upgrading of any excessively violent films (even those showing scenes of torture) because they display the freedom of film to uncover aspects of society which are normally kept under the carpet; but the downgrading of any showing intense sexual situations because they might unduly influence young people.",unsup
1024_0,"Mèxico, being an almost 100% Catholic country produced several nunsploitation flicks in the 70's. Before censorship took a big role in Mexican movies, there were many, many exploitation flicks for different tastes. I must admit that this isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it is a movie that deserves a chance and will please fans of gore and sleaze. <br /><br />Many Mexicans tend to easily ""scare"" with plots like the one in ""Satànico Pandemonium"" because it deals with two restricted topics in Mexican society : sex and religion nastiness. <br /><br />""Satànico Pandemonium"" does not rank high on the exploitation Heaven but it manages to deliver quality intense violence and disturbing images for those who enjoy this kind of cinema. The language used in this movie is macabre and it's very relevant for the plot. If you speak Spanish you might enjoy it more than if you watch it with sub-titles because most of the words have no exact literal translation.<br /><br />The raw acting is a key factor in the movie. For example, the afro American nun that cries all over the convent because of her depression for being black is something that may seem random; you just watch her cry and suffer. The scene takes relevance as the plot develops (she's ""aided"" by Sister Maria who convinces her to commit suicide).<br /><br />Many situations like that one make you think ""where's the coherence with these Mexican film makers?"" but that's just to add tension. Also, the convent is very creepy mainly because of a great art direction. The atmosphere in the convent is sinister and the fact that the Devil is prowling outside, makes it even more a scary place. I praise the cinematography because the movie is visually stunning. The events take place at noon at night and the movie still looks sinister.<br /><br />The music is also convincing and very disturbing. The director knows how to create a disturbing, scary setting with the correct use of light, sounds, and suspense. The acting is not that good because most of the main actresses were amateur, except for Pezet who delivers a brave, solid performance. She's a beautiful woman with nerves. She was perfect for the role because she's extremely pretty, has an angel face; the perfect prey for Satan. She deserved more leading roles in her career. Too bad that this was her last movie. She was just too beautiful to be involved in Nunsploitation flicks! Veteran t.v. and movie actor Enrique Rocha gives a strong performance as the Devil and his voice is scary alone. He was great. The rest of the cast is just plain and dull. <br /><br />The movie goes directly to the point immediately after it starts. After the opening credits, Satan seduces Sister Mary and then the Horror starts immediately. She is tempted in several scenes, and finally, when she falls into Satan's tramp, she starts a rampage of sex and murder. Thank you! <br /><br />Maybe Europeans aren't easily scared with topics like The Devil seducing or torturing nuns,but here in Mèxico it's a different deal. The Devil is by far the scariest character in Mèxican culture. Now, if you mix him with religion (which is something very delicate here) you have a terrifying experience. In the first minutes there is auto flagellation (good gore) , lesbian nun sex, and Satan. Mèxico created this interesting premise which sadly, in the 80's and 90's was heavily banned because of a censorship campaign against violence in cinema. I'm glad that these movies get DVD releases for Europe so they can recognize the country's talent in Horror. <br /><br />The main problem with this movie is the lack of continuity and coherence in the plot. First, we only know that the movie takes place in the inquisition times because of the tombs of the nuns. So, the movie is set in the mid 1600's. Then, what should we realize about the ending? It's too easy to blame the Devil! but it does no makes sense. <br /><br />Anyways, ""Satanico Pandemonium"" has become somewhat a cult nunsploitation movie; it was even referenced in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". The weak point of the movie is that it hasn't aged very well. The veteran director is heavily influenced by classic theater techniques and acting and does not gives a dynamic mood to the movie. The camera angles are boring at some points, and some events truly last longer than they should. For example, when Sister Maria takes care of the sick cow, or when she realizes she's been tempted by the Devil.<br /><br />At some point it looks like a very old Horror movie but with lots of gore. Talking about gore, the movie has two highlight gory scenes in my opinion. First, when Sister Maria seduces and later stabs Marcelo to death. The scene is weird because it makes you wonder how would it be if a nun ""like that"" would seduce you, and later, it grosses you out. I felt sorry for Marcelo's tender grandmother. The other scene, is when Sister Maria is stabbed to death by the other nuns. The gore is great in this movie. Expect stabs, self punishment, and a glorious flashback sequence involving the inquisition (excellent for those who like gore). <br /><br />Mèxico is not all about raw, cheesy, gory flicks involving wrestlers, with no plot. Mèxico had a HUGE potential in the genre but as many people know, politicians and Constitutional Presidents banned the rise of Mexican exploitation. Sure, it came back in the 80's but not as a Horror sub-genre; it came among low budget Action movies and the typical Valentìn Trujillo flicks.<br /><br />Give a try to ""Satànico Pandemonium"" because it offers blood, gore, a scary plot (for us who respect the religious factor), and a dark atmosphere. Buy it for all of it's goodies. I believe there's an unrated version.",unsup

The way Blue is made to undress and is transformed into a different person was very dramatic and really shows the ""two shades of blue"". I really enjoyed how Blue and the lead guy fell in love and I liked how Sully tried to protect Blue. I didn't like the part where JJ Clark showed up at the brothel and Blue screamed, she looked really stupid. This is the only part of the movie I didn't like.

I once had arachnophobia and therefore this episode stuck out in my mind from childhood. But even when I saw it back then, I had an appreciation for the relationship dynamics between the female and male lead. And that's really the magic of Night Gallery - being able to scare you but still having a solid story to do it with. I wish that today's TV shows and movies would take a hint from Night Gallery. It's OK to have CGI (which wasn't available back when Night Gallery was done) but don't get so caught up in it that the story suffers (or is nonexistent). Thank goodness for hulu.com.

This one, where a normal 'human' couple if you like, hear their 'baby' or young son crying out for a glass of water. They argue over (From what I can recall)whose turn it is to get him the water etc. Then I think it IS the father, who hands the glass to 'Junior'.

10254_0,"This is one of my favorite stories from the Night Gallery. It looks so ordinary on the surface - a bright sunny day and a father is checking out a military academy he might send his wayward son to. There's no spooky music here or characters screaming in terror. In fact, if you were to stumble across this episode while channel surfing you might think it was just some boring two-star family drama. When you sit and watch it, however, the horror slowly drips down on you until you're drowning in it, not knowing if you should laugh or scream.<br /><br />Pat Boone plays the lead and makes for interesting casting. He's probably the ultimate Hollywood goody two-shoes and yet here his performance leaves you wondering whether the father is a good-guy faced with a gut wrenching decision, or a bad-guy simply contemplating an evil one. Very disturbing. Good directing from Night Gallery regular Jeff Corey and some creepy cinematography from Lionel Lindon add to the chills.

10276_0,"Director Daisuke Gotoh clearly doesn't understand the erotic psychology behind a successful (or even interesting) women-in-prison film. I mean, the primary component of dykey-women-molesting-other-women-behind-bars seems to have completely escaped him in this one! Yoko Saito is certainly well-cast as the pretty Scorpion, unjustly accused, convicted, and thrown into a California women's penitentiary on clearly spurious grounds. But once she's there, nothing even remotely interesting happens. Yes, there are some dykey-looking women about, as well as some pretty young female inmates just waiting to be sexually victimized by them. But it never happens. There's really no lesbianism whatsoever. Instead, it's the male warden and his guards doing all the dirty work. So why the women-in-prison setting? If he didn't want to include scenes involving girls with other girls he should have set this story in a nightclub or brothel. Obviously this director knows (or cares) nothing about this genre of films, and it was very disappointing as a result.",unsup

There were a couple ridiculous plot points, but overall it played out very simply and satisfyingly. The acting was decent to poor, but the leads were adequate. Yoko Saito did a good job as the lead playing in both English and Japanese and managed to handle some of the cheesier dialogue bits. The one real twist in the plot was worked up to very well by some of the dialogue between Nami and her male friend, not giving it away entirely, but foreshadowing effectively.

10278_0,"SCORPION'S REVENGE (1997; AKA Sasori In USA) Japanese interior designer (Yohko Saitoh), wrongly sent to an American cooler for the murder of her husband via exploding car, gets a flip through the back catalogue of women-in-prison movie indignities: delousings, showers, beatings, cafeteria catfighting, yard catfighting, a warden who quotes scripture while he brutalizes and rapes the fishies, raging American bull dykes, and an absolutely inhumane LACK OF PANTS! But Scorpion's revenge ain't against the system, baby, even though she does manage to fuck it up a bit on her way out; it's with the people who killed her man and sent her away, and when she breaks out with another fish in tow, a blind girl looking for her own justice against the sleazeballs who offed her Latino guitar-picker boyfriend, and discovers in a staggering revelation that her husband faked his own death in order to kill a bunch of shyster lawyers who were suing his company (not a spoiler!), she realizes his clock must be punched, permanently. This probably should've been more tongue-in-cheek, but perhaps director Daisuke Gotoh wasn't aware just how big a joke the genre has become to American B-movie filmmakers and fans. As such, however, he does include everything one has come to expect from a babes-behind-bars epic; problem is its all crammed into the first 40 minutes, the remainder being dedicated to a rather laborious trek across the desert and the decidedly predictable and anti-climatic round of score settling with The Man.<br /><br />Worth it if you can find it cheap, and compared to fellow Asia Extreme labelmate BEAUTIFUL PREY, a fair bit more fun.

While the plot is a trifle flat, and a couple of the supporting actors (Victoria Tennent) stretch their abilities, the cinematographic techniques and direction by John Frankenheimer are superb, and Caine and Lilli Palmer are absolutely wonderful. The elements of film, particularly outdoor angles from crowded streets and icy violin sound effects echo back to the great spy movies of the Cold War era and lend an almost Hitchcockesque eeriness. The seedy Berlin night life is not overly useful and a bit tawdry, but it passes as just a spicy interlude.

(Michael Caine as a noisy simpleton? Give me a big, fat Nazi break! Not even Michael Caine is that good of an actor.) <br /><br />The idea that life in a Nazi thriller unfolds like a Pink Panther sequel without punchlines is too difficult to swallow. Some of the scenes actually seem to me as if they were outtakes or lighting checks that ended up in the final edit by accident. I don't think I would care so much except that it is my beloved Michael Caine I am talking about here. The screenwriter should have been shot instead of this movie. The whole thing would have been more successful and excusable as a light comedy starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling Holcroft, neatly missing numerous assassination attempts while managing to solve the entire mystery purely by accident. <br /><br />The queasy merger of bad 80's costumes and completely uninspired cinematography is the only conspiracy worth noting in this absurd waste of talent and money. I think the whole awful eighties cocaine craze was rampant on this movie set, and that no-one could tell a terrible script from a silver spoon by the time the whole thing got into production.

Before the picture starts Maltin tells of and shows many scenes that a few years after the year this film was made (1931) wouldn't have been allowed. Like scenes of Ms. Stanwyck and Joan Blondell undressing or of a bootlegger (Ben Lyon) getting away with murder. Clark Gable, in one of his early roles, impresses greatly in his scenes with Barbara as the brutal chauffeur who's in cahoots with the crooked doctor in her hospital. And it's always a treat to see Charles Winninger in another one of his kindly elderly paternal roles, here as Stanwyck's moral superior.

She discovers that they're illness is being exacerbated by a crooked doctor. It seems that the doctor and the kids' mother's chauffeur (Clark Gable, looking delightfully evil in his black chauffeur's uniform) are conspiring to let them die. Unfortunately, Stanwyck is obliged to follow the doctor's rules, as per her profession's code of ethics (hopefully this has changed over the past 75 years!). It's a good story, and Stanwyck is fantastic in it. My major complaint is that Wellman goes for some strange comic scenes. The girls' mother is an alcoholic (the doctor and chauffeur are also trying to keep her inebriated, so she doesn't stop their murder plot), and she always has friends over for parties. The drunks are all played as comical, which grates against the more serious themes of the movie. Joan Blondell co-stars as the nurse who takes care of the kids during the day (and apparently she's nowhere near as concerned as Stanwyck about it, or at least she doesn't do anything about it!).

10297_0,"""Night Nurse"" released in 1931, in the depths of the Great Depression, was the kind of film Warner Brothers cranked out at that time. Barbara Stanwyck plays Lora Hart, a woman down on her luck who applies to become a nurse. She does so, with success. The initial part of the film takes us into the inner workings of a hospital -- circa 1931. Stanwyck is befriended by a fellow nurse, played by Joan Blondell, who provides much comic relief throughout the film. Stanwyck's first assignment is to take care of two sick children of a wealthy mother. Soon she begins to realize there is a sinister plot to starve the children so various people can profit from the children's trust fund. The children's mother is a serious alcoholic and seems to completely ignore her children, leaving them in the care of nurses and a housekeeper. A young Clark Gable has an eerie and threatening presence playing a chauffeur, who apparently is in league with the alcoholic mother and the children's sleazy doctor. Brought into the mix of all these characters is a charming bootlegger (prohibition was still the law of the land) played by Ben Lyon. He falls for Stanwyck after she patches him up from a bullet wound and doesn't report it as required. The film is clearly ""pre-code"" meaning the code was down in ink but largely ignored by studios until enforcement in 1934. There are some scenes of Blondell and Stanwyck dressing and undressing, and we see them in their undergarments several times! Liquor flows freely, despite prohibition and there are several scenes of various drunken party-goers. One drunken man tries to assault Stanwyck. There is some fairly graphic violence by 1931 movie standards. There is also some funny, snappy dialogue from Stanwyck and Blondell. My favorite line is when Stanwyck, after wrestling with the drunken, neglectful mother, looks down at her passed out on the floor and says ""You mother..."" I won't give away the ending, as it is a bit bizarre, but this is an entertaining film. See it just for Stanwyck. She gives a spirited and tough performance.",unsup

Well, Lora meets a handsome, injured bootlegger while working in emergency, who plays in this film later as she gets involved working duty caring for two sick little girls (who actually looked quite healthy to me!) who are dying of starvation in a wealthy household that is occupied by an assemblage of real shady characters including a mean chauffeur in black, an abrasive housekeeper, a bad doctor with a weird eye twitch, and the mother who proudly proclaims she's a ""dipsomaniac"".<br /><br />This is a pretty weird movie - it's really comprised of two separate halves. The first half is the reasonably normal, and interesting story of a young nurse learning her trade and dealing with typical hospital stuff - the only slightly odd thing being the constant focus on showing these nurses in their lingerie as they change from street clothes into uniform several different times. The second half of this film is just a real shift in the focus of this story to the very oddball starvation/murder plot.

The story is pretty weak but for fans of Barbara Stanwyck this is an absolute must see. Her performance is very energetic (aggressively shoving her face very close to that of other people, punching big guys, hurtling bottles of champagne around etc.) and she really comes through as a sensuous  albeit tough as nails - nurse. For some time she must wear a tiny band aid on her chin which makes her even more attractive. Joan Blondell is also great as her gum chewing friend, setting the standard for vulgarity. The movie basically deals with the ethics of the medical profession which is treated with amazing cynicism. <br /><br />The highlight for me was the conversation between the excited Stanwyck character and an older Pappy-type doctor. The nurse suspects foul play in a particular medical case and Pappy tries to calm her down with sensible arguments. The nurse quickly loses her patience and her temper, shouting. Aw, ethics, ethics, ethics! I'm through with ethics!"" It's really a well played scene which brings the character and temperament of the nurse to the fore and reflects the atmosphere of the whole movie. I also liked the unethical doctor with his facial twist and snazzy uniform which must have influenced people who created the wardrobe for Starship Enterprise. His big office has very elegant Art Deco trappings and is in stark contrast to the rather cramped conditions in the ethically operated hospital shown in this movie.",unsup

Therefore, the children are wasting away from starvation while a useless maid dithers around and Stanwyck tries to get the hospital to intervene.<br /><br />The film would probably be instantly forgettable if not for the fierce performance of Stanwyck, who throws herself (quite literally) into the role of savior, taking punches, getting thrown into a wall, all while dishing out some punches of her own. This is film-making of the sensational Warners variety, featuring lots of suggestive dialogue, shots of Stanwyck and her nurse buddy, the saucy Joan Blondell, in their underwear, and a world in which things like murder are o.k. as long as they're done for the right reason.

Earlier in the film Stanwyck kind of winks at the rules where Lyon is concerned and she makes a friend who comes in real handy when dealing with Gable and Harolde.<br /><br />Lyon is fine, but this seemed to be a part James Cagney would have been perfect for. And Cagney going up against Gable would really have made this a classic.",unsup
10304_0,"""Night Nurse"" is my favorite film , in a big way sister! This movie contains humor on various levels. Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Blondell are 2 tough broads who can hold their own against the evil Doctor Granger and even ""Nick The Chauffeur"" played by Clark Gable. It does help to be an actual pediatric night nurse to understand this movie to its full potential. The camp is both intentional and unintentional. The movie has a rebel flair with the nurses mouthing off to authority and even befriending a bootlegger (who is one of the heroes of the film).The movie is pre-code so it's pretty spicy for the 30's . You can even see Barbara and Joan in their skivvies.The medical lingo is very amusing. Barbara Stanwyck's character has ""blood type 4h"" and they got some very pudgy little kids to play the starving children. I own the video and have passed it along to co-workers who are also pediatric night nurses and it has become a cult favorite amongst my collegues.",unsup
10305_0,"Barbara Stanwyck as Lora Hart is having a little trouble getting a job as a nurse in a big hospital. Seems she needs a high school diploma. That's no problem for Lora, she just shows middle-aged Dr. Bell (Charles Winninger) a little leg and a big smile, and everything is set. She soon becomes chums with another girl with some nice legs of her own, Maloney, played by Joan Blondell. The girls are in nursing school in the hospital, though it looks more like reform school. Be in bed by 10 p.m., no boy friends allowed, and work, work, work. The pace is fast and the interns are hot on the make, but Lora falls for a bootlegger when he shows up for treatment with a bullet in his arm. No problem, we just won't mention that on the medical report. The girls get an outside assignment taking care of some little girls who are slowly being starved to death for insurance money by ""Nick"", (Clark Gable!) Lora stands up to Nick as only Barbara Stanwyck can when she's steaming mad. No problem for Nick, though, he clocks her a couple of times, (the camera cuts discreetly when Lora takes it on the chin) and down she goes. There's a chiseling doctor Dr. Ranger in on the scheme, a real low-life type wonderfully played by Ralf Harolde, whoever he is. But have no fear, Lora and Maloney will set things right somehow. This outrageous film is highly recommended. A must for Stanwyck and Blondell fans.",unsup

There are also some nice directorial touches from William Wellman.

10307_0,"Gritty depression era flick, showing why Warner Bros. was the studio of record. It's tough broads here that get the leads. There's Stanwyck (before her teeth were fixed) and Blondell (gum-popping her way through the Nurse's Oath), both trying to survive grabby interns, unscrupulous doctors, murderous families, and no money. No, this isn't Young Doctor Kildare. Just compare Night Nurse with that sappy 1940's series for insight into what the Production Code did to social realism. Here nurses break the law, doctors violate their oath, and unless you go along, you don't work. Not exactly the professional AMA image. Sure, it's contrived melodrama. But there are elements of the real world here that would disappear from the screen for 35 years, courtesy the PC. Also included are gamey one-liners, mild strip scenes, and a really sardonic look at motherhood, along with a very scary Clark Gable. For a brief period from around 1930-34, Hollywood operated with the lid off, pressed by audiences with no work, no money and no prospects. Movies like NN reflect that reality, which was, of course, too unvarnished to survive. So catch up with this neglected period when you can, especially if the movie's from Warner Bros., like this little gem.",unsup
10308_0,"The young NIGHT NURSE watching two sick little girls finds herself pitted against a gang of heartless criminals.<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck is a standout in this taut little film. Independent, resourceful and tough as nails, she pits herself against the bullying authority she encounters in the hospital and the absolute evil she must confront at the bizarre private home where she is sent to work. An intelligent & spirited actress, it was roles such as this which would hasten Stanwyck into becoming one of the biggest film stars of the 1930's.<br /><br />A fine cast gives Stanwyck ample support. Ben Lyon plays the free spirited bootlegger who takes a shine to Barbara. Brassy Joan Blondell portrays her worldly wise roommate. Charles Winninger brightens his few scenes as a cherubic doctor, as does Edward Nugent as a flirtatious intern. Vera Lewis is properly implacable as the stern head nurse and Blanche Frederici adds a note of strangeness as a distraught housekeeper. Not yet a star, Clark Gable is very effective as a menacing chauffeur.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Willie Fung as a Chinese patient & Marcia Mae Jones as the sick child who needs the milk bath--both uncredited.<br /><br />The Pre-Code status of the film is readily apparent. Stanwyck & Blondell are viewed in their lingerie as often as possible and Stanwyck must suffer some mighty rough handling from various villains in the movie.

10310_0,"I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2-3 years. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, I am able to embark into the past of all the great Star Trek episodes. For those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- ""I like The Next Generation"" the best. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation. But to be quiet honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager's episodes more than TNG. Voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG. Granted Data from TNG is great but it eventually gets old but Voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! Endgame portray him as a husband married to an ""organic"", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before Endgame, to disobey Captain's order and make ""human"" mistakes. Unlike DS9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo that carried them with his personality. Of course the rest of the Voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, Harry Kim and Tom Paris -- very natural. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank God for Kate! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. What a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our Cosmic expanse.",unsup
10311_0,"SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by ""front loading"" some Voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all moot.) I did like how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having Janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew(s) pulled it off.",unsup
10312_0,"After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, ""journey is more important than the destination"". Unbelievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to the normal life.<br /><br />Worst ending ever.",unsup

The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a ""poison"" that in, essence, ended the Borg was great. The way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. However, they did bring them ""home"" and the way they did it was fantastic!! It was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. Ending it with Tom and B'Lanna having their baby just as they enter the Alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today.",unsup
10314_0,"The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because Kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. I saw them when they were originally shown on TV here in the UK but had forgotten most of it. Am I satisfied with the ending? I think I am. Naturally as I fan I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. In many ways ""Endgame"" is similar to Next Gen's ""All Good Things"" The involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. A new romance starting in the finale (Troi and Worf in Next Gen and Seven of Nine and Chakotay here), which results in death in the future. I truly loved ""Endgame,"" fair to all characters, Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. B'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom. Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. Harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. The Doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name Joe! But of course the Captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. The Borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of Voyager. Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though, the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen. Maybe she wasn't available though. The special effects are fantastic, the Borg sub space hub and the Borg queen falling apart! It's very tense. Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. And what a wonderful idea to get inside a Borg sphere for protection, on the DVD special features they say it was like the Trojan horse. Voyager could have continued. If it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in Harry's speech and what Tom said because his wife and child are there. And then they could have got home in a film!<br /><br />Overall, Voyager was a bit hit and miss. The sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. The two episodes set in the Holographic Irish village are horrible! My perception of Seven of Nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn't true. When she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. And her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a Borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. I like her, especially in ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""Imperfection,"" and ""Human Error."" When Naomi Wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. Chakotay became my least favourite character. Gone was the chemistry with Janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time. I loved seeing Tom and B'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. I always liked Neelix a lot. Tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with Neelix. Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. The Doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates (""Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy"" is fantastic!). Janeway is my favourite Captain of any series and you can tell Kate Mulgrew is really enjoying it. <br /><br />I wish there was more, I love Voyager!",unsup
10315_0,"Thumb Tripping is a little-known hippie road movie made in 1972. It's little-known for a reason. The reason is that it is somewhat poor.... and those who saw it (of which there were few) did not build for it a word-of-mouth reputation of any note. There are a few cast members in it who went on to bigger and better things, notably Meg Foster and Bruce Dern; also the director Quentin Masters would later score a sexploitation hit with the Joan Collins movie The Stud. However, in this film there is very little of interest other than a freewheeling narrative that offers occasional insights into the permissive and casual attitudes of the youth of the late '60s/early '70s. In most departments, Thumb Tripping is a tedious, dated, muddled and totally forgettable misfire.<br /><br />Young hitch-hikers Gary (Michael Burns) and Chay (Meg Foster) make their way around California together, hitching rides when they can and spending evenings under the stars. Gary is a kid from a decent background and a home in Connecticut who has chosen to postpone going to college in order to ""discover himself""; Chay is a more freewheeling type who just wants to experience the here-and-now while she is still young. During their wanderings, Gary and Chay come across various weird types and sometimes find themselves caught up in bizarre adventures. They're picked up by road-racers Smitty (Bruce Dern) and Simp (Larry Hankin) who threatens them with a switchblade; later they hitch a lift from an embittered woman (Joyce Van Patten) who has hated hippies since her daughter ran away to become one; another time Chay finds herself being ogled by a middle-aged trucker (Mike Conrad); and in their final ""thumb trip"", they find themselves travelling with dysfunctional husband-and-wife alcoholics (Mariana Hill and Burke Burns).<br /><br />The episodes come and go without leaving much of an impression, partly due to the fuzzy soundtrack (which renders much of the dialogue inaudible) and partly because of the thoroughly uninteresting main characters. Michael Burns gives a non-performance that may one day be recommended by doctors as a cure for insomnia, while Foster fares little better as a dislikable female lead whose character seems to think she's free and happy but in reality is just a self-centred slut. The gallery of background characters are far more fascinating than these two, but they come and go too quickly to make much of an impact. The script (by Don Mitchell, from his own novel) has no idea where it's going and merely ambles along from one pointless situation to another. Where Easy Rider was similarly plot less and freewheeling, at least it had interesting characters and situations, and charismatic performers. Thumb Tripping has none of that and is a very tough film to endure from low-key beginning to unsatisfying end.",unsup
10316_0,"The strikingly lovely Meg Foster and baby-faced, shaggy-haired Michael Burns are a flighty, wide-eyed, free'n'easy hippie couple who encounter a stunningly twisted array of distinctly all-American grotesque characters during their aimless trek across the United States in this compellingly groovy ""Easy Rider""-inspired early 70's road movie curio. Foster and Burns make for likable leads, with the underrated and always captivating Foster particularly fine in a rare starring role (Foster basically reprised the character in the oddball cannibal horror outing ""Welcome to Arrow Beach""). Bruce Dern contributes a stand-out scary cameo as a jittery, switchblade-wielding psycho motorist in a yellow hot rod; Joyce Van Patten likewise turns in a marvelously hideous portrayal of a bitter, smugly square and shockingly venomous suburbanite harridan mother from hell; Mariana Hill and Burke Burns are alarmingly gross and vulgar as a loud, trampy white trash wife and her boozy, insecure macho jerk husband, and ""Hill Street Blues"" TV series regular Michael Conrad is solid as a burly, scruffy, friendly, but horny truck driver who gives our wandering twosome a ride into San Francisco.<br /><br />Quentin Masters' spare, sharply observant direction wisely avoids the usual stylistic overkill excesses which mar many counterculture films made at the time, opting instead for a more timeless, largely unadorned and plainly naturalistic style which has dated pretty well. Don Mitchell's episodic, yet coherent script conveys a series of vividly realized, colorful and engrossing vignettes with topmost clarity and acuity, perceptively nailing the rampant hedonism, moral permissiveness, Nixon-era unease and paranoia, corrupting and erosion of flower child ideals, mass disillusionment, and intense spiritual malaise which defined the early 70's. Harry Stradling, Jr.'s dewy, golden-hued cinematography gives the picture a sunny, beautifully lyrical look while the soundtrack boasts plenty of nicely harmonic and flavorsome folk ballads. The carefree tone darkens as the film leisurely progresses towards its hauntingly downbeat conclusion, thus ending things on a startling note of grim self-discovery.

However, it is sad and depressing. Not many people will want to watch Marie struggle to accept the fact that her husband is 'gone' and that she is now alone. Her husband has been gone for 3 months and she talks about him as if he never disappeared. The husband's mother, who is in a nursing home, makes a comment to Marie telling her that she's probably crazy and boring too. Maybe that is why her son disappeared-because he was bored with his life & his wife. Why anyone would make such a comment to someone suffering is beyond me. But for some reason, there it is, this pathetic scene hinting that Marie might be insane. She isn't. She's grief stricken and unable to accept the fact that her husband may be dead, perhaps by suicide. If this all sounds dismal, be prepared. This is NOT an uplifting film at all.

10322_0,"This is a film that is slow in developing but not without losing its grip. It is not boring unless you are 18years old. Actually, this is a mature film for mature viewers who understand the complexities and bliss of mid-life relationships that are further complicated by the loss or disability of a steady partner whose patterns are well learned and experienced along that long path. Long relationships lead to an acceptance and craving for shared performance, habits and body language - either good or bad. In long-term relationships, bad times are blended with the best. All bad times are without risk. <br /><br />As others have commented, Marie (Charlotte Rampling) has lost her husband Jean (Bruno Cremer) in a low-keyed holiday trip to their seaside residence in southern France. We do not know much about them other than it appears that their relationship is either strained or okay. We learn those elements not in high-level drama but one of progressive mental torture going on in Marie's mind - particularly after Jean disappears beachside while Marie is basking on the sand.<br /><br />This script is a tiptoe dance between the real and unreal; between sanity and insanity; between a temporary mental aberration induced by bereavement and the need to retain the memory of a life-partner at all cost.

10325_0,"This charming sober film from French filmmaker Ozon poses the questions of loss and denial, sexuality, and the many ways that we deal with grief. When we grow to know someone all our lives, how do we function when our conditions have changed? And in what ways do we compensate to fill the voids and human touch that we linger for?<br /><br />The story is simple enough, but the meditations are complex and intricate. Marie and her husband are on holiday in the picturesque south-west of France when at a deserted beach, the husband goes for a swim but never returns. The extensive majority of the film is concerned with Marie's perception of her world after her husband mysterious disappearance and her reflections on sexuality and ageing.<br /><br />This is a fine film. In tradition with the French school of film-making, there are many quiet, meditative scenes; moments where Rampling's character glides through ornately furnished rooms and houses of her affluent companions who offer support and counsel. The sparse dialogue creates an introspective and reflective film - totally refreshing and mature in the demands on the audience.<br /><br />The city streets of the Landes region and the associated beaches are serenely photographed. It is truly beautiful to watch. Add Ozon's exceptional direction that heighten the loneliness and regret enforced by Rampling and the film is a treat for the senses.<br /><br />Rampling's performance deserves a special mention. She carries the entire film for the duration. She is a sensual, sexy, sophisticated and fully-developed female. Her acting is minimal but it works to great effect. She is able to communicate her feelings of denial, regret, giddiness and womanhood with sometimes no dialogue, realistically playing Marie with the constraints of society's norms but tempted to break free and unleash her feelings and guilt buried under the sand. This is one of the great film performances.<br /><br />This was so refreshing and beautiful to watch, a treat to be engulfed in picturesque Landes for a while. It was a truthful and honest portrayal of how we cope with loss; when we are so used to living our lives, taking our loves for granted. Ozon and Rampling were both stunning, sensual and reeled me into their world. By the film's end I was reluctant to leave her world of memories and regret, and I drifted of listening to the credits as long as I could. I wanted to continue listening to the crash of the waves, the peaceful tides pulling me under the sand.",unsup

Excellent movie, I will recommend it to friends and try to see a few more Charlotte Rampling movies. It is a snowy day here and so this movie went very well with our weather.

When Marie does attempt to move away from Jean's memory, the new lover, after only one night, is already volunteering to help her with her ""problem"". The brief scene with mother-in-law is superb. The allusions to Virgina Woolf are also key to understanding. <br /><br />For me, it is the sympathy given by Ozon to the character of Marie, the one who has to cope with loss, which gives this film such power. Without a hint of indulgence, we see a strong character attempting to survive an experience which has shattered her life.",unsup
10329_0,"A surprising change of pace for (up to that stage in his directorial career) shock auteur François Ozon in the wake of bourgeois facade-ripping as REGARDE LA MER and SITCOM, this minimalist masterpiece deals with love, loss and grief yet never becomes heavy-handed.<br /><br />Middle-aged Marie (luminous Charlotte Rampling making a belated but extremely welcome return to leading roles), an English literature professor at a Parisian university, quite literally loses her husband (hauntingly sad-eyed Bruno Cremer) while on seaside holiday. She takes a nap on the beach as he's out swimming. When she wakes up, he has disappeared. Accidentally or voluntarily drowned ? Hiding perhaps from a stifling marriage ? Ozon offers no solid answers but focuses but focuses on Marie's stubborn denial of her husband's departure as she resumes her professional and social life as if nothing had happened. While those around her assume she's slipping from sanity, the truth proves considerably less tangible and far more nuanced. A tentative affair with the friend of a friend seems doomed from the start, leading to the shattering final scene, all the more heartbreaking for being open to any number of interpretations, none of them particularly cheerful. <br /><br />Even though the filmmaker has reigned in his wicked humor and morality-defying shock tactics, this fortunately doesn't mean he has gone all solemn on us. The general lightness of tone might indeed startle in light of the subject matter, plus there's even an astonishingly erotic moment when Marie imagines herself being groped by both husband and lover in an elegant masturbatory fantasy. Ultimately, this is very much Rampling's show and clearly intended as such. Rarely out of frame for more than an instant here, she delivers the type of performance  both subtle and sensuous  that has been her stock in trade since she started enchanting movie audiences worldwide back in the '60s, her mysterious beauty undiminished (if anything, augmented more like) by the passing years. Contrary to her personal code of conduct (she will rarely work more than once with the same director, always looking for new experiences to further her craft and personal growth), she went on to star in Ozon's deceptively upbeat SWIMMING POOL and took a supporting role in his first failure to date, the atrocious ANGEL.",unsup

The movie never wastes its time to pull out tears or laughs from the audience. All the enjoyment flows out naturally and uncontrived. Nor is the director's artistry on parade. Rather the film's beauty is subtle and supportive. The cross-cultural clashes are much more bilateral and accurate than in the more acclaimed ""Lost in Translation."" Though the ""coming out"" theme is old, this handling of it is fresh; and the script is well written. The cast works very well together. I wish I could see more of them. I'd especially like to see some other of Hiromoto Ida's works. I also very much appreciated Anna Ferguson and Alec Willows in this.",unsup
10330_0,"This is a tour de force for Charlotte Rampling - her performance alone makes this worth watching. <br /><br />Things begin with Marie (Rampling) and her husband Jean (Bruno Cremer) heading out of Paris to their summer home in the country. In following the mundane activities of their trip and first night away we learn quite a bit about them. The rhythms of their married life have long since been grooved. Marie's attachment to Jean is apparent, but Jean's feelings for Marie are less well established and this becomes a relevant plot element.<br /><br />On the day after their arrival at the summer home the couple go to the beach. While Marie suns herself, Jean goes for a swim and he does not come back. Marie goes through all of the expected reactions - waiting anxiously, calling the police, witnessing the search, and finally giving up. It is here that we move into the deeper waters of the story, as it were. The expressions on Jean's face just prior to his going on the swim sets the tone of ambiguity as to the cause of his vanishing. Was his disappearance an accident, suicide, or willful?<br /><br />Marie deals with this bewildering situation by entering into a state of denial and this is where Rampling and Ozon boost this movie beyond the ordinary as they subtly trace the gradual chipping away of Marie's illusions. The reaction shots of Marie's seeing an older man swimming in a pool, or receiving a recorded message that a body has been found, are powerful in their understatement. The use of lighting to accentuate Marie's moods is quite effective, like the use of harsh white light when she is in obvious agony.<br /><br />Rampling is at the top of her form and she completely puts to rest any idea that a woman in her 50s cannot be sexy.<br /><br />The subtext of how Marie's friends try to deal with her reactions is engaging, making you wonder about the best way to deal with a friend in a state of denial. You want to be supportive, but also want to encourage them to face what you think are the realities of the situation.<br /><br />Relationships are always more complicated than the participants understand and, as is the case here, a traumatic event can unleash emotions and thoughts previously unexplored. I took the ambiguous ending to personify the hopes, fears, and unknowables in Marie's relationship with Jean, and maybe in all significant relationships.",unsup
10331_0,"After seeing Swimming Pool (my first Ozonic experience - his first American-language movie), all of his previous films and now this one, I've come to the conclusion that Francois Ozon is a truly brilliant filmmaker, someone who is capable of foraging deep, DEEP under the surface of things - as only a Scorpio can - to convey what is nearly non-conveyable in films: psychological state and motivation. Charlotte Rampling is superb in Swimming Pool, and in Sous Le Sable (Under the Sand), she creates one of the most stunningly subtle and heartbreaking portraits of grief that I've ever experienced; this film is profoundly sad, a brilliantly accomplished, astoundingly mature piece of work.",unsup
10332_0,"Charlotte Rampling does an award-winning acting job depicting a woman's reaction to her husband of 25 years disappearing into the ocean in the south of France. They seemed to be a serenely and smoothly functioning couple taking their annual vacation together. They had a lovely seaside villa and seemed to know the routine of travelling, opening the house and preparing to relax. They seem like a loving couple, but she is in her 40's, fit and trim while he was aging and overweight. He got wood for a fire and she made pasta and they went to bed together with affection, but no passion.<br /><br />The next day was lovely and he lovingly applied sunblock to her back. He went swimming by himself as she preferred to relax for awhile and read a book. She never saw him again as he never returned. She was frantic and initiated a search, but no body was found. The following year she was trying to get on with her life, still denying her husband's death. Her friends grew increasingly concerned and tried to fix her up with a pleasant single man, and eventually she agreed to have a date with him and make love. The image of her husband remained with her in a soft, friendly way.<br /><br />Events accelerate, the finding of the body, a shocking talk with her aged mother-in-law. Ultimately she seems to come to grips with reality as she breaks down and cries on the beach, but the sudden ending must be watched closely for a clue to how she eventually copes.<br /><br />After the love-making scene, there is a shocking realization by the new boyfriend, that their physical intimacy meant nothing to her after the fact. This is what many lovers feel when they realize the physical intimacy was only skin deep and temporal. One wonders by what magic enduring love and commitment happens.",unsup
10333_0,"The Psychologist Elizabeth Kubler-Ross highlights five stages of the typical mourning process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. It is clear to see that Marie does not follow this process. And although she clearly expresses denial, her denial is not shrouded in isolation. This is first shown in the dinner party scene as she discusses Jean flippantly and in the present tense, Ozon using a study of Marie's friends' reactions to show that something is not right. This runs contrary to the writings of both Freud and Kubler-Ross, who observe the social withdrawal of those in self-denial, as if the only way to maintain the mourner's alternative reality is to cut him or her from all outside factors which have the potential of ruining the fantasy. This scene is difficult to watch due to Marie's matter-of-fact delivery with no hint of melancholy, and the friends' inability to confront Marie or force the issue of Jean's death.<br /><br />Marie's grief seems to be marked as atypical by her willingness to face these outside factors, which comes across as almost stubborn rather than genuinely self-deluding. Under normal circumstances, such a high level of social interaction would appear to lead to a greater sense of reality for the bereaved. However, Marie is armed with several defence mechanisms which she uses when directly confronted with her true situation. In the first instance, when confronted by Amanda after the dinner party and after a lecture, Marie uses changes in language to switch the tone of the conversation. It seems that she can feel more comfortable and isolated when speaking in English, and perhaps she was able to use the same technique before Jean's disappearance to exert her own individuality within her marriage. This use of language draws certain comparisons to isolationist behaviour seen in psychological studies of grief and bereavement, for example Colin Murray Parkes' elusion to ""the widow who spoke in a whisper for fear of making reality too real"".<br /><br />Later in the film, as Marie's defences begin to get breached, she resorts to both anger and insults in order to keep her personal reality from being destroyed.. she transcends her calm veneer for the first time when confronted about Jean by Vincent, and when confronted by her mother-in-law she resorts to petty insults. This series of reactions seems to come to a head when she returns to Lit-et-Mix to face the final reality of her husband's death. Having seemingly run out of ways to deny her situation, Marie breaks into laughter. This can be read either as a confirmation of Marie's descent into madness or as a prelude to her final moment of acceptance as played out on the beach in the final scene.<br /><br />Despite these deviations from established psychological writings, Marie's behaviour does in part correspond to some of Freud's theories as set out in ""Mourning and Melancholia"", in particular when he describes mourning as the process of ""reality-testing""6. Marie's actions can be seen as a way for her to examine her new emotions and social surroundings since the loss of Jean. In fact, the film could be seen as a study in the way in which Marie explores several alternative realities: the awkwardness of her fledgling relationship with Vincent displays her hesitation in leaving her personal reality of a monogamous life with Jean, as if she is performing experiments on herself, constantly testing the limits of the world she has conjured around herself. This is expressed visually by Ozon in studying Marie's physicality, the way in which she interacts physically with her surroundings. The most explicit ""reality-testing"" scene occurs when Marie is lying on her bed and is caressed by six hands, those of Jean, Vincent and herself: It can be seen almost as the transition sequence between two of her realities. Ozon also frequently uses reflections of Marie's face in order to convey the idea of her physicality, literally highlighting the reflective nature of her self-discovery: in order to truly recover from the loss of her husband she must re-identify herself, perhaps also coming to terms with her own mortality, the subject of which is most explicitly conveyed in her conversation with Vincent about Virginia Woolf. It is also hinted at during her conversation with her mother-in-law: the two of them trading insults over who will be the first to end up in a psychiatric home, while Ozon makes studies of the mother-in-law's aging features. The scene in which Marie passes out when seeing a cemetery could be seen as a reaction to Jean's death, but could equally be interpreted as her reaction to her own mortality.<br /><br />However, despite these references to the psychology of loss and bereavement, Ozon's film cannot simply be read in this way. The film is as much about life as it is about death. In a way, the presumed death of Jean runs merely as a sub-plot in the story of Marie's self-discovery. The essence of the film is clearly based around Charlotte Rampling's central performance, which remains ambiguous but powerful throughout, reflecting complex ideas about attachment and loss, and leaving behind several unanswered questions over the reasons for her actions as well as what results from them. Ultimately, Ozon's film is intended to remain open-ended, as displayed in the final scene where Marie runs towards a mystery man, perhaps reflecting the ambiguous nature of life and death in a secular society in which death is no longer associated with notions of an afterlife or ritualistic coping mechanisms intrinsic in Christian interpretations of mortality.",unsup
10334_0,"This film is magical. The way that it is directed through to the way that you really don't quite know what is going on at the end. The portrayal of Marié by Charlotte Rampling is inspiring that such a high level of acting could be protrude on film still. Her performance is one of the best I have ever seen and really drives home the subtle sub plots of what makes her do and think what she dose. The switch between scenes in English and French works well also though some of the subtitles are not so good. This alas is a constant problem. Bruno Cremer's performance is both realistic and spiritual which really drives home his characters role. I was amused to see that François Ozon thinks of Germans in the same light as his countryman Anton De Cones, as a race obsessed with nudity. As the only other occupants of the 'German Beach' were naked.",unsup
10335_0,"""Sous le sable"" tells the story of Marie Drillon, excellently performed by Charlotte Rampling, whose husband disappears when they are on holiday after he went for a swim in the sea. What follows is the struggle of Marie who can't accept the fact that her husband is dead and that he will never return. In several scenes is shown that Marie still talks to her husband in the present tense, like he's only gone for a couple of days but will return very quickly. In one of the last scenes we know for sure her husband is dead because they found his body. In that scene, we see again that she just can't accept it because the body that is found has all the characteristics of her missing husband, but she still denies that it is her husband.<br /><br />Charlotte Rampling gives a remarkable performance. The movie is partly based on something Francois Ozon experienced in real life. Years ago, when he was at the beach, he saw a woman who's husband was went for a swim in the sea and didn't seem to return. He always wondered what happened to the woman and her missing husband. Excellent movie, Francois Ozon is a brilliant director. I've seen ""8 Femmes"" as well and this is also a very good movie, although it's something completely different.<br /><br />8/10",unsup

They take their annual vacation un the south of France. The drama unfolds as they're enjoying a beautiful summer's day at a local beach. While Marie lies down to have a sunbake, Jean, after a reflective glance at the surf, rises, and heads into the surf for a swim. After dozing off, Marie wakes up to find that her husband is not lying beside her. She searches the beach and he is nowhere to be found. He has vanished, her nightmarish ordeal has begun. The best decription I can find for this film is that it charts the intense, oscillating experiences of one woman as she has to face the loss of her husband in a horrible way.

Even as Marie tries to accept a new lover but struggles, because her husband is still very much with her. This film was dark, even grim, but recommended.",unsup
10339_0,"Losing a loved partner one has lived with for years can be a devastating thing to cope with, but not really knowing if he is dead or alive -- or worse, going into denial that he has died -- can lead a person right into the edge of the abyss. Such a thing should never happen to anyone, but it does to Charlotte Rampling's Marie Drillon, a university professor who is happily married to Jean Drillon (Bruno Cremer in a near-silent performance). The opening ten minutes describes everything one needs to know about them: their dynamics, their love for each other unquestioned, quiet, but as potent as a garden filled with the scent of roses and lavender.<br /><br />On a trip to the beach, Marie drifts into sleep as Jean decides to take a swim. When she awakes, she misses him and thinks he's within the area. Unfortunately, he is not... and the more she looks for him the less likely it is that he is alive. A search brings forth little comfort, and she if left from there on in limbo, wondering where Jean may be, if he is alive, or dead.<br /><br />Her behavior from then on becomes increasingly erratic, which is an indicative of what happens to a person who's become so attached to another and the horror that slowly arises to the surface when those ties are suddenly, irrationally severed. She catches a glimpse of a young college student and is suddenly unable to continue giving a lecture; she seems a little off at a dinner party; she has gone on a spending spree (buying a new shirt and tie for Jean) despite the fact that her account is overdrawn and due to Jean's disappearance she has no access to his funds (which leaves her in a predicament as to how will she survive). Above all, she is acting as though Jean is still alive and well.<br /><br />A particularly disturbing moment arrives when Marie decides to embark on an affair with another man who comes into her life: Vincent (Jacques Nolot) which establishes that maybe reality for her has finally cracked. Vincent and Marie begin making love, seen mainly through the motion of their hands... and then Jean's hands come into the left of the screen, identified through the blue shirt she bought him. It continues in perfect silence, with only her moans barely overheard. A later sequence has this odd threesome repeated as Jean observes her and Vincent making love from a distance.<br /><br />In many ways, UNDER THE SAND has the elements of a thriller. A disappearance, the search, and the inevitable revelation as to what exactly happened. However, when a person is so deep in denial, those things matter little, if at all. Marie receives the crucial call from the morgue and decides to ignore the message left. She seems unable, unwilling, to face what has happened, and one of the more heartbreaking scenes of her anguish take place in a small montage where she is seen alone, sitting on a subway station, then riding the train, looking forlorn and empty.<br /><br />Charlotte Rampling makes this her movie all the way. She's on screen at all times, and her performance is reminiscent of the one Juliette Binoche gave in BLUE. As a matter of fact, Binoche herself might have been the better choice, but Rampling is outstanding in her willingness to portray a woman in intense pain, suffering and coming apart from the inside out, desperate for answers but equally closed to them. Her disconsolate weeping at the end is an emotional tour-de-force wrenching itself out from its restraints, and that final scene on the beach as she runs towards the enigmatic, ghostly image of a man she believes to be her husband (whom she seemingly cannot reach) packs a devastating blow to the senses. A powerful masterpiece from the hands of Francois Ozon.",unsup

The much-more-talked-about 'Lost in Translation' does not come up to this one, but 'Translation' is of course not a bad movie.<br /><br />One could say that the wisdom of 'Tokyo Cowboy' is a bit simple and obvious, yet these themes one cannot discuss and dwell over enough.

10340_0,"The death of a beloved person implies also a big loss, a loss which dependents refuse to believe.<br /><br />Director Ozon flurries and unsettles the viewer again. It begins with the cut right after the vanishing of Marie's (Charlotte Rampling) husband Jean. It's summer. The married couple apparently enjoys their vacation at the sea. Suddenly, Jean disappears and the search of the police remains without a result. Cut! Marie sits with friends at a table, ostensibly in a flashback, outside it's winterly, Marie tells from Jean, who is waiting at home. She goes shopping and buys some clothing items for Jean. However, by and by, the viewer realizes, that this is not a flashback: It is the time after Jean's vanishing and Marie lives on as if nothing has happened.<br /><br />The film concentrates only on Marie and her denial of reality, her non-acceptance of the loss, which goes so far, that she i. e. sees Jean in the door while she sleeps with another man, Vincent. Jean remains ubiquitous in Marie's life, he is always there and only disappears in a few scenes when reality comes in her life for a second. He is also present in the character of Vincent, whom she replaces with her missing husband, talks to him and treats him as if it was Jean.<br /><br />That's why the film takes place in Charlotte Rampling's face, who shows a fantastic performance: She appears in every scene, her mimics symbolize the whole suffering of Marie. In clear, calm shots Ozon glances at the emotional recovery of his protagonist. Behind her chilly facade, Rampling only forebodes the psychological precipice of her figure and screens the film from flying out into melodrama. Rampling is the undoubted highlight, the highlight of a film which leaves behind an unsettled viewer.",unsup
10341_0,"Under the Sand (2000)<br /><br />The plot is simple, almost too simple, and because very little happens, it depends on mood and deeply serious thinking about death to survive. And on Charlotte Rampling to have the nuance and range to pull it off.<br /><br />And it works, overall, because of just those two things: heavy subject and Rampling. There are issues (and tricks, cinematically) with ghosts and memories, but these play small against the bigger strain of the lead woman dealing with this sudden trauma in her life. Even though the main event in the movie happens at the start, I don't dare mention it because it's surprise is important (I didn't know it was coming, and liked the way it was handled very much). <br /><br />Director Francois Ozon never seems to quite nail down the pace and editing of his films, at least for American sensibilities. Even the sensationally complex Swimming Pool doesn't quite use its material to propel us in every scene. But let's turn that on its head and say that Ozon uses emptiness and gaps in the action to give his movies breathing room, or maybe, in some old fashioned sense, the make them serious. When nothing is ""happening"" you can only start to think and dwell on the events, along with the characters. In Under the Sand there is nothing else to do and yet it's exactly what Rampling in her role has to do: think and dwell. It's slow at times, yes, but only if you don't let yourself relax and get absorbed.<br /><br />And, like the character, confuse what is real from what is chimera, and what she needs with what she once had, and even one man from another. Even her fluid bi-lingual abilities add to the duality. By the time you get to the final scene you are left wondering what true love really is, and whether it's worth it. Because maybe it is. She has something most people do not, and it seems like a sickness and a gift at once.",unsup

Also noteworthy, stylistically, is a rare instance of unease being effectively evoked in spite of sunlit sets and daytime outdoor shots.

I think the loss to the woman of her husband is like suddenly confronting the loss of the last 25 years of her life. To be able to cope with this changed reality she must cautiously explore a new experience; she is afraid to let go of her past and afraid to take hold of a future. I believe at the end of the movie we are shown that she will continue to refuse to relinquish the past, yet, invariably, it is shown to her that she must go on, embracing the present, as must we all.",unsup

François Ozon's Sous le sable is a worthy exception. Carried almost entirely by Charlotte Rampling, this story of a woman unable to face the loss of her husband marks the return to form of a great actress. Through her sensitive handling of her character one tends to forget the effort that must have gone into depicting an intelligent woman slowly going to pieces. Ozon managed to capture the special sensuality of an older woman especially well in the erotic scenes; imagined or otherwise. It is not an easy film to watch, the subject matter too painful, but its unflinching honesty coupled with Ramplings moving performance make it more than worth-while.",unsup
10346_0,"François Ozon is a rare director, one who takes a simple story, places it in the eyes and bodies of his cast, and simply lets the tale tell itself. SOUS LE SABLE (UNDER THE SAND) is an unforgettable film experience that probes deeply into our psyches, hearts, and reason: how do we cope with sudden death? Opening quietly in the French countryside, a loving middle-aged couple begins a brief vacation in a family house, quietly and lovingly going about removing dustcovers, opening shuttered windows - settling in for a time of being alone together. Marie (Charlotte Rampling) is a professor of English in Paris (her specialty is Virginia Woolf) and Jean (Bruno Cremer) is her retired husband. Their long-term love is palpable: Ozon provides almost no dialogue, as none is needed to establish this special relationship, so powerful is the non-verbal communication between Rampling and Cremer. They visit the beach the next day and while Marie is sunbathing, Jean goes for a swim - and never returns. Marie searches for him, engages lifeguards, and ultimately returns to Paris, trembling but intact. Months later, while Jean is never found, we see Marie reacting as though he still exists. She visualizes him in various situations and the two actors (yes, Jean is present in these scenes) interact as though nothing has changed. But Marie's friends note with great concern that she is 'delusional' and make various attempts for her to seek professional and emotional help. When news eventually arrives that Jean's body has been found, she internally denies this possibility but eventually returns to the vacation house town to identify the bloated corpse. Even at this point, though obviously in shock, she denies that the corpse is that of her beloved Jean. She walks back to the site where she last saw Jean and in the distance a figure rekindles her hope...<br /><br />Charlotte Rampling delivers a performance wholly committed. She communicates the spectrum of feelings of this challenged strong woman with her eyes, her gazes in the mirror, her interaction with her class of students, her friends, her admirer with such power that makes her Marie a wholly credible creature stricken by loss yet surviving in her chosen manner. It is one of the great performances of cinema. The entire small cast of this film is perfection. Ozon is a magical director and continues to prove he is one of the most honest and quietly powerful figures in today's cinema. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Grady Harp",unsup

AVENGING EAGLE is one of the most memorable that I have seen. The script takes the viewer back and forth in time, the flashbacks allow the viewer to discover more and more about its two protagonists (played by TI LUNG and Alexander FU SHENG). So interwined are their pasts that it is quickly obvious that they should actually be each other's enemy. But the logic is such that we can also readily accept that they put aside their differences, eliminate as many of the Iron Boat clan sent in pursuit of TI LUNG's character, and finally, take on the evil leader of the clan (KU FENG).<br /><br />I found the dialogue especially good and satisfying, and I am sure that others who have seen the film, can think of at least four or five instances, whether the dialogue demonstrates wonderful irony, quiet sadness, and ensures the two heroes display real qualities of heroism.<br /><br />SUN CHUNG and his crew show a wonderful eye for their locations, the exotic and distinctive costuming and weaponry (of the heroes, and also the thirteen Eagles, and of course, their leader).<br /><br />With the opening shot, it was obvious this film was photographed away from the usual locations. That, the initial meeting of the two leads, their first skirmish with the Iron Boat gang, and much later, the remote inn that they 'rent' for a month to set up an elaborate ambush, and lastly, the lair of the gang, where SUN builds up to and sustains a lengthy climax, demonstrates a lot of imagination.<br /><br />Even the music is effective, despite the mono sound of the Region 3 IVL/Celestial Pictures DVD, and is largely 'original'> This film is so good that I have not even broached the subject of its martial arts. And that alone, I believe, is reason enough that I consider AVENGING EAGLE one of the best martial arts films I have seen.<br /><br />(PS: Consider a quarter century later the Japanese were making films along the same line, ie.

The main character displays a depth of emotion that is not often seen in this genre managing to convey in word and memory induced vignettes the tragedy of his life, the wrongs he has committed to survive and his sorrow at what he has become. The man he has wronged is also compelling in that instead of exacting quick revenge as we see with other martial arts films he wants to know his families murderer to find out why he killed them. The ultimate protagonist and leader of the Eagles is also good but more in line with other kung fu baddies than as a truly original character. I would recommend this movie because it manages to tell a story of vengeance and human frailty without sacrificing either of them.",unsup
1034_0,"Different, fun and like life itself doesn't have an exact Hollywood outcome. <br /><br />The main characters learns and teaches others. One of my favorite scenes is about the reason for taking off shoes before going into the house - it's basically so you leave the world and it's chaos outside your sanctuary and not to avoid getting dirt that can be vacuumed up later.<br /><br />Also, when you put two different cultures together you learn a lot about each. The good and the bad. There is some basic dishonesty in our own culture and also many humorous sayings that arn't to be taking literally.<br /><br />I also recommend renting Shall We Dance.",unsup
10350_0,"Avenging Eagle is the story of a man Chi Ming-sing (Ti Lung) who after years of killing for a brutal gang decides to leave and seek revenge against them and their leader. The gang, know as the Iron Boat Clan and in particular the men he raided with the 13 Eagles. All were raised from birth by Yoh Xi-hung (Ku Feng) to be brutal killers to obey his every command. Each with his own hand made eagle medallion and weapon. Now the 12 reaming eagles are sent out to find Chi Ming-sing and either kill him or to bring him back. Chi Ming-Sing soon runs into a wanderer Cheuk Yi-fan (Fu Sheng) who does not reveal himself at first, but decides to crusade against the clan together. As they head towards the clans base they are attacked in waves by the Eagles and defeat them one by one. As the movie goes on Chi Min sing tells his story of how he saw the light after being forced to kill a pregnant woman and betrayed the clan. In the final battle of the movie with Yoh Xi-hung, it's revealed that his companion is actually his worst enemy, the husband of the woman he killed and the man he swore to die by. In one of the great battles of Kung Fu cinema they combine forces to defeat there common foe. Chi Ming sing then forces Cheuk Yi-fan to kill him allowing his wife's spirit to rest in peace.<br /><br />Avenging Eagle is easily one of the greatest films the Shaw Brothers ever created. The story is great, played out with a solid cast of familiar A list Kung Fu actors from the Shaw's studio at the time. As with most Shaw Brothers films the action is non stop and choreographed well. Fans of the violent fights often seen in Shaw Brothers Kung Fu films will not be disappointed in the level of action and brutal fights in this film. The costumes worn by the actors were very unique. The ""Eagles"" each have a unique outfit with a primary color and medallion that matches their outfit. Also each member of the gang is usually equipped with a different or unique weapon. Ti Lung uses the 3 section staff and Fu Sheng uses a pair of hidden knives for what he would become know by, ""the double blade."" Among other interesting weapons would be Yien Lin's (Johnny Wang Lung-wei) brass ring and of course Yoh Xi-hung' iron claw gloves.<br /><br />Overall this is a masterpiece from the great Shaw Brothers. Compared to non Kung Fu films I'm sure most would find it stupid. But to fans of the Shaw's and Kung Fu films this is one of the great ones and not just your average Kung Fu flick. This isn't just action and killing but great story as well. Without a doubt this gets a big ten out of ten stars. Truly a classic.",unsup

I think perhaps the director suffers from ADHD, or some such malady, as he wants to do a Satanic movie, but then again, Satan does not have the power to do anything...?...I don't know. This is basically just a convoluted mess centered around dogmatic Christian belief and peppered throughout with Catholic doctrines, used here and there whenever convenient, but otherwise ignored.<br /><br />A complete waste of film, if you ask me.<br /><br />It rates a 3.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.",unsup

Every cliche in the book is here, plus red herrings that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot that seem to be pursued way too far.<br /><br />I loved their casting of Alex, though. He's a total dreamboat -- powerfully magnetic, sensual, articulate, and just wicked enough to hold the attention. Stole every scene he was in, which wasn't too hard considering nobody else was even vaguely sympathetic. It's too bad the heroine wasn't more sympathetic.. it was hard to care about her at all (or see why anybody else cared about her), she was so rude, self-obsessed, almost abusive, and brittle.<br /><br />I also really disliked the directing -- every trick in the book is employed, or rather overemployed, such as ominous music, sudden noises, and excessive foreshadowing. Basically, this was just a very non-thrilling thriller that said nothing new at all.",unsup

10355_0,"Did I just watch a late 90's, made-for-TV thriller starring Kim Delaney? Boy, I must either be really bored or completely out of other material to watch because it's generally known that Miss Delaney has yet to deliver a decent film. To refer to this ""Devil's Child"" as being just mediocre would be a huge understatement, as this is a totally unoriginal and amateurish attempt to tell a religious horror story in the tradition of ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Omen"". Delaney stars as a 30-something and single photographer. At age 10, she survived a deadly fall of a rooftop thanks to her mother, who made a pact with Satan himself (apparently, the Dark Prince didn't have anything better to do then to stroll around in hospitals) and, to return the favor, Nikki, after a life of infertility, will give birth to the Antichrist! And indeed, shortly after moving to a new apartment with a dubious reputation, Nikki meets a handsome and seemly sophisticated man who quickly turns out to be the devil in disguise. The plot is full of stupid little holes and it's particularly funny how Nikki ""coincidentally"" gets into contact with Alex (the devil). First she inherits a large sum of money, which allows her to move to the apartment complex where He and his accomplices live, then a poor dog has to die and then finally, she has to be rescued from a running wild car old-timer! The total lack of blood, sleaze and gruesome make-up effects is acceptable, since it's a made-for-TV horror film, but what about that totally ridiculous and pathetic ending?!? Dig this: (HUGE SPOILER!!!) They're about to baptize his son, the newly born Antichrist for Pete's sake, and all the Prince of Darkness does to prevent this from happening is produce a little bit of wind???? And then when Nikki walks out of the church with her baby, He just stands there and WALKS away?! He WALKS AWAY, like a little boy that didn't get what he wanted! They call that an ending? Delaney's performance is quite bad, but Oscar material compared with the work of her supportive colleagues, including Matthew Lillard; who would reach somewhat of a star-status later with the utterly retarded ""Scooby-Doo"" movies. There is ONE remotely interesting sequence in this film, though, and that's inside the auditorium where Mr. Satan gives a lecture about good and evil.",unsup

All the major horror clichés are stolen from ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE OMEN- there is NOTHING the viewer won't see coming as any sort of shock or surprise. Good performers like Matthew Lillard and Kim Delaney don't add anything. For a supernatural tale, there's really nothing in the way of special effects. The script is terrible, and the direction barely adequate. It blows me away that anyone connected with this film would waste time and money to create this piece of trash, even for something concocted for TV.",unsup
10357_0,"A not completely lousy movie from George Cosmatos! That said, the promise this movie has is never fulfilled. What could have been a Lewtonesque study of a man's breakdown degenerates into a silly sub par horror film. Peter Weller plays a career obsessed banker who finds himself becoming even more obsessed with getting rid of a pesky rat that's invaded his swank brownstone (actually more of a mod pad with a castle-like facade). Director Cosmatos, never one known for showing much tact, keeps the game of cat and mouse interesting for a good while until it just gets boring. Frankly, this is the type of movie with a ""less is more approach"" would need a star far more compelling than Weller. He's not bad, but he is dull and his jokey dialog doesn't help. Shannon Tweed plays his wife and looks dynamite, but really has nothing to do. Jennifer Dale is OK as Weller's smitten co-worker. Judged next to other Cosmatos fare (anyone for COBRA?), it's a masterwork.",unsup
10358_0,"...and its still one of my favorites. The title doesn't really give an indication of what the movie is about. Tho the strangely preternatural rat co-star is indeed of 'UNKNOWN ORIGIN', it sounds more like a sci-fi title than a movie about Peter Weller being driven insane by an escalating rat problem in his house. Not just an ordinary rat problem, this rat is an advanced tactical model which manages to stay one step ahead of his human antagonist like some darkside Tom and Jerry cartoon.<br /><br />I even liked this better than the mother of all 'rat' movies, WILLARD. Weller can do no wrong in my book, hes consistently good and in fine 'Peter Weller' form here. Cant say I ever saw a theatrical release on this, possibly was direct to video. I have a copy somewhere that I recorded off HBO or something way back then. I didn't realize it was out on DVD, I'll have to track down a copy.",unsup

People who got excited by this forgettable mediocrity have probably seen far too few (good) horror films, or are huge Weller fans.<br /><br />I didn't have a problem with a mere rat being such a challenge for what seemed to be an intelligent man, i.e. the absurdity of the premise is acceptable because this is a horror film. However, the only way this film should have been done was to do it as an all-out comedy. Though, even then it would have probably gotten dull sooner rather than later due to its one-joke premise.<br /><br />Maybe if they had made the rat out to be much larger, or if they had gotten him to look like Martin Sheen... Though, admittedly, if we had a Sheen rat we could never believe that he could be that intelligent.<br /><br />Perhaps if it looked like Barbra Streisand...?

Well, imagine if that guy was a poodle-sized sewer rat.<br /><br />I wondered going into this movie why Peter Weller would agree to star in what is essentially the rat-equivalent of Jaws: The Revenge. I got my answer about twenty seconds into the film, where it opens on a shot of Shannon Tweed, playing Weller's wife here, showering. Umm, okay.<br /><br />She leaves, along with Weller's extremely dimwitted kid to stay at a hotel (only to pop up later in the movie scantily-clad back in her hotel or in a dream sequence in order to meet some strange 80s boob quota I suppose).<br /><br />Weller is doing fine by himself, (staying behind to finish some work), until the dishwasher overflows, eventually upsetting a rat who decides to move into his apartment. Its hard to gauge just how big this thing is supposed to be until it decides to crawl up under the covers in Weller's bed later, apparently he's the size of a tomcat.<br /><br />Weller does his best to get rid of the rat, upgrading from normal rat traps to (what are basically) miniature bear traps. When the medieval rat traps don't work or come back gnawed on he decides to get a cat, which also comes back gnawed on (or replaced with a cheap stuffed animal that resembles his cat). When he decides to ignore the rat he chews on on his surge protector, fuse box, and therein cutting off the power.<br /><br />Weller runs around the house, bashing holes into walls in search of the rat, is plagued by nightmares of birthday parties where the giant rat jumps out of a sheet cake (?), and where his dimwitted kid ends up mixing in various rat poisons in with his cereal. The finale brought to mind Arachnophobia as it ended in a dank basement; the film ending maybe twelve seconds after the rat's been dispatched as Weller brushes himself off as if the last two hours hadn't just happened just in time to greet his wife and kid at the front door. I'm sure they won't notice the completely demolished apartment.",unsup

There's lots of rat damage in this film as they squirm through unexpected places and bite the hell out of things and cause general mayhem. I personally liked it.<br /><br />Peter Weller (Robocop, Naked Lunch) turns in a memorable performance as a corporate shirt who obsesses over rats in his home. To protect his family, he wilds out with steel traps, poison, a nasty looking homemade bludgeon and more. I would have had a lot of respect if he doused his entire house with gasoline and then tossed a cigarette in there and said ""Yippy Ki-yay, motherf--ers!"" That was really what I thought was gonna happen at one point but sadly it didn't.<br /><br />If you are a fan of rats (or LAWYERS who are the next best thing, hahaha, OK I'm shutting up now), I would highly recommend watching Of Unknown Origin.

A relentless and seemingly indestructible rat has invaded his domicile and makes his life a living hell.<br /><br />While this effective little tale delivers the good shocks and suspense required for a tried-and-true horror story, it operates on more than one level, as it equates Barts' drive for success in his professional life with his need to prove his superiority to this upstart rodent. He ultimately will have to get in touch with his inner primitive nature in order to come out on top. Not only that, he has to struggle to hold on to his sanity as the rat seems to be making all the better moves.<br /><br />Underscored by Ken Wannbergs' solid and spooky music, the film features some great animal action. Lots of repellent closeups of the rodent performers helps to maintain the creepiness factor of the picture, and there are some great sequences as the rat runs amok throughout the place (the moment when the infernal thing pops up out of the toilet was a fantastically orchestrated shock!).

I am also rather desensitized to horror films. Salo, Irreversible, and others I am ashamed to mention, hardly phase me. I've seen other rat films. Older rat films, and new ones haven't bothered me. I had purchased this film with about 20 others, and it looked silly, was inexpensive, so why not? I find myself awake this morning at 4:30 am, and in need of mild entertainment. Here is where my horrific morning begins. <br /><br />I am a 24 year old female, so to all you guys reading this, never show a woman this movie. Show her Cannibal Holocaust, not this. I slap in my DVD of this film, pull my covers back and wait for 90 minutes to pass. 10 minutes later I am screaming like a wild woman being attacked by the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This movie is INSANE! I own 1000 horror movies, and I thought I had built up enough tolerance and desensitization to endure any form of human torture. Wrong! This is one evil, hideous, demon possessed rat. By the time an hour had passed I was clutching on to my baseball bat, and wouldn't you know? A shadow from my ceiling fan caused a sharp movement on the floor., and I was running down my hall in a terrified frenzy. It may be that girls like me just can't cope with a rat, but it might just be that this movie is hell bent on preying on everyone's natural dislike for these foul little beasts. I sat and hoped that WHAT I KNEW WOULD HAPPENwould not. It did. I was so happy when this movie was over, but ever happier I gave it a chance. It is rare I feel fear, and this was a great reminder. It isn't Citizen Kane, sure, but it is more entertaining. It is my worst fear, realized. Except for that whole broom in girlie prison thing. I digress. <br /><br />I know you guys are tough! I know you ARE THE MAN! BUT! If you can make it through this movie without jumping in your seat, well, you should join the Navy Seals. Or better yet.you would make a great executioner. This is a nerve wrecking modern spin on MAN VS. MONSTER. No kidding! <br /><br />This movie gets a ten from me. After sitting through 1000 movies that people say are scary, I find this fabulous little gem, and come to realize just why I love horror. This is horror. Nobody gets tortured, raped, or beheaded. That is fine, considering how brilliantly the film makers took a simple fear and found a way to torture the audience, and not one lesbian bimbo vampire was skinned alive. I was impressed. <br /><br />I wish I was so well versed and I could give you the most complex analysis of the technical specifics. I am not. Peter did a great job in being convincing, and some of the camera work is great I think. The camera often acts as the eyes of this evil monstrosity. The mans wife in this movie is really pretty, and you see her boobs. So, you guys might like that if nothing else. I think the film was very well done, and most effective at making it's point. I would tell you all about the shocks, but that would ruin them for you. Some must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />I'm a girlie girl, sure. I bet you can't make it through this movie, in the dark, without your baseball bat either. If you are on the fence and wondering if you want to give it go, do it.

With little to work with in terms of sets and exteriors, Cosmatos shows his chops as a director who tries to make each shot pay off in a particular way. The overhead shot of Weller looking out over the ""human"" rat race crossing the street draws an interesting parallel with the main story.

10367_0,"The premise of this film isn't exactly original, but a story like this has great potential both for a psychological thriller and for a fun horror flick...but unfortunately, Or Unknown Origin doesn't quite manage to excel at being either. The focus is more on the battle between man and rat than providing the sort of schlocky horror that the eighties produced so prolifically, which is fine; but it never probes too deep into the psyche of the central character, and the film plays out like a movie that should be fun, but largely isn't. That's not to say that it's a bad film, however, as there are a lot of good ideas on display, and the film also features what may be a career best performance from Peter Weller. The plot sees a man who recently completed the rebuilding of a house being left alone when his wife and child go on holiday. He stays behind to try and win a promotion, but he doesn't count on an onslaught of torture when it turns out that the house he put together has become infested by a rat. What follows is an all out war between man and one of the world's most notorious pests.<br /><br />Rats are one of horror cinema's most popular animals, and it's not hard to see why. There is a scene in this film that sees the central character make a case against rats, and it really makes you realise the reason why these animals are so often feared. Of Unknown Origin starts out slowly, but builds some momentum half way through when our hero begins his personal war against nature. I wasn't expecting much after the first half hour, but the film surprised me somewhat by the way it eventually comes together, climaxing with an exciting sequence that sees the central character really go off the rails. Peter Weller really is superb in the lead role, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film was the reason he went on to take the lead role in the classic Sci-Fi thriller 'Robocop'. It's a shame that director George P. Cosmatos doesn't seem too keen to get fully inside the character's head, as the potential for a great psychological thriller is definitely there. This film may have been better if it was handled by someone like David Lynch, but despite its imperfections; Of Unknown Origin is still worth seeing.",unsup

Cosmatos, who also helmed the Sly Stallone action vehicles ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" and ""Cobra,"" wrings plenty of tension out of the creepy premise, expertly maintains a snappy pace throughout and stages the ample jolting shocks with a considerable amount of flair and skill. Moreover, the smart and trenchant script by Brian Taggert offers a potent, gripping and provocative allegory on ""civilized"" man's latent capacity for extreme violence and brutality needing the proper stimulus to be activated (the incredible conclusion with Weller chasing the rodent around his posh abode while brandishing a spiked baseball bat is both disturbing and exciting in comparable measure). Weller's outstanding intense performance easily carries the picture, with fine supporting turns by Jennifer Dale as Weller's concerned secretary, Lawrence Dane as Weller's tough, but fair and equally worried boss, Louis Del Grande as the macho building superintendent, gorgeous ""Playboy"" Playmate Shannon Tweed as Weller's hot babe wife, and Maury Chaykin as a jerky co-worker.

Hell, even you you don't mind rodents it might freak you out a bit. Peter Weller is always a great actor, and he stars in this film as Bart, a man who wages an all out war with one hell of an angry rat while the rest of his life begins to fall apart because of it. He is the only leading actor in this film, and he carries it almost completely on his own. His dinner table speech about the dangers of rats was both hilarious and a bit unnerving at the same time. I liked how this film was almost self-mocking in parts, though it always kept a straight face about it and never went to far. The rat's point of view shots really show this. The scenes with the rat were all very well done, congrats to whoever trained the rat. The plot was very original, and I liked how smart the rat was. Always a couple steps ahead of poor ol' Bart. I think I jumped a foot when the damn thing came out of the toilet. Last but not least, that was one heck of a bat he made near the end! Overall, this is a great film.

Apparently whoever did the costumes wasn't alive then, because there was no attempt to find any clothing for the actors that actually resembles the fashions of that era, and sorry, but Cyndi Lauper and Blondie were not hot singers in the late 1980s or early 1990s, in fact, their careers were dead.

I enjoyed how it followed the students, those with exceptional talent and those who really enjoyed music (but lacked in the natural talent department).

10388_0,"I just watched this film (on European television), but didn't see from the very beginning what it was called. So I looked it up here on IMDb. ""Strip Search"" is a terrible title. What were they thinking? That I think is an example of what is wrong with the film. They have a story with a very interesting political premise, but they gave it some crap title more appropriate for a straight-to-video Shannon Tweed flick.<br /><br />Well, it IS an interesting premise, that the U.S. domestic response to 9/11 has brought the country closer in some respects to the police states it still publicly condemns. It is a premise with which I strongly agree. And the plot vehicle of playing the same dialogue in a U.S. and a Chinese prison was a very good idea. But it is all really poorly done.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the dialogue itself, which is clichéd. It really could have used a few rewrites. Surprising that it came from Tom Fontana, of the great ""Homicide: Life On the Streets"" TV series.<br /><br />The other problem is that except for Glenn Close and Maggie Gyllenhaal, the other actors are unable to rise above the hack dialogue. Ken Leung I thought was particularly bad. And in movies, the ultimate blame for poor performances has to be laid at the feet of the director, in this case the legendary Sidney Lumet. (But let's face it, Lumet hasn't made a truly great film since 1976's ""Network"" (1976), and not even a good film since 1988's ""Running On Empty."") With the exception of the acting of Close and Gyllenhaal, the whole film feels like a hack job. The political message is hammered home with all the subtlety of a German jazz band, complete with inter-cut speeches about freedom and democracy from U.S. presidents, and a fadeout with statistics about U.S. detainees.

He then proceeds to ask the same question, but extending the time period from 1 day to 10 years.<br /><br />The director then examines two identical situations differing only in their location. The first scenario is of an American woman being hooded, and then abducted by Chinese security forces and then taken to an unknown location where she is asked some uncomfortable questions. The second scenario is of the same thing happening to an Arab man (they never really say which country he's from) being hooded and abducted and taken to an FBI building where he's questioned.<br /><br />This film is effective in asking the viewer whether the US wishes to fight any war in a manner similar to how Communist China (with no supposed civil freedoms) fights a War on Terror. Additionally, the viewer is asked whether civil liberties which have taken many decades of struggle to obtain and keep are so worthless that they can be discarded for any period of time. One of the most ironic parts of the movie is that the quote by Thomash Jefferson ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."" is used by the Arab suspect in his political science thesis and then the FBI agent questioning him asks whether the use of this statement is a call to violent dissent.<br /><br />The problem with this film is that both scenarios use precisely the same dialog and this while initially effective gets pretty boring at the end. Also in pre-Abu Ghraib world people could be happy at the realism of the level of abuse that both parties experience, but we now know that a lot worse can and does happen.<br /><br />I can understand why this film isn't shown more in the US, no-one wants our country compared to Communist China, and certainly not at this time.

10392_0,"As those who have seen this movie know, this is a film designed to play on the paranoid minds of people who think that the United States will turn fascist over-night in an effort to fight the war on terror. I am stunned that in our uber-P.C. society there are so many people who actually think that American law enforcement agencies are torturing people to extract information. Sidney Lumet, and everyone who liked this movie, are clearly among them. I didn't want to review this movie based on its bad political message, but since this movie was made solely to make a political statement and not for any entertainment value, I have been forced to criticize it based mainly on its politics.<br /><br />This movie juxtaposes two parallel stories. In one, an American grad student (Maggie Gyllenhaal) studying abroad in China is arrested by the Chinese secret police and brutally interrogated by means of a humiliating strip search (she is suspected of consorting with terrorists). In the other story, a young Arab man in the U.S. has the exact same experience, except it's the FBI doing the interrogating. The dialogue is the same, word-for-word, in both stories. For those who don't understand, Lumet was kind enough to beat you over the head with the point that *GASP* perhaps America is becoming like communist China! One of the biggest failings of ""Strip Search"" as a movie is the incredible lack of any subtlety whatsoever in the story's execution. As I mentioned, the dialogue in each story is EXACTLY THE SAME. A more intelligent screenwriter could have effectively made his point simply by making the two people's experiences similar. There was no need to have the same dialogue. Are we expected to believe that two people in two separate countries are being interrogated the exact same way, complete with the same dialogue, at the exact same time? Statistically, that's probably less likely to happen than fifty people in fifty different countries all being killed by flying champagne corks at the same time.<br /><br />It's amateurish problems like this which make it obvious that this movie is meant solely as a political allegory, and not for entertainment set in reality. Which brings me back to the lame political message. Does Lumet really think this is how the FBI interrogates people? If something like this was ever done by an FBI agent, that agent would lose his/her job, and probably his/her boss would be fired as well. You don't have to work for the FBI to realize that. My dad is a retired FBI agent, and hearing what really happens at the FBI makes this movie look pretty stupid in comparison. A real FBI agent could have his career destroyed if he uses a racist term. Imagine what would happen if agents routinely engaged in the sort of interrogation that this movie shows!<br /><br />For those who still are not convinced, think about it in a practical way. The FBI is a bureaucracy, and the people at the top of the organization all want to protect their own butts. If it ever became known that the FBI tortured people to obtain information, do you think any of those people would still have jobs? Of course not; heads would roll. That's why the guys at the top have every reason NOT to want the agents to do things like this, and why they would fire any agent who did. On the other end of the spectrum, the agents also don't want to lose their jobs. Movies tend to portray cops and FBI agents as ""Dirty Harry"" types, people willing to break every rule to catch the bad guy. In real life, it's never worth losing your job over something like this. <br /><br />Anyway, it's generally infuriating to see a bunch of oxygen-wasting Hollywood celebrities pretending like they have any idea what goes on in American law enforcement agencies. And that's what this film is, as well as a pretty obnoxious insult to all American cops and enforcers of the law who risk their lives to protect people like Sidnet Lumet.",unsup

Since a large percentage of the population are unaware that political agendas of media owners exist, they passively believe what they see on their nightly TV news or read in their daily newspapers. They are taught to fear the unknown, to trust their leaders implicitly (because they use nice words in speeches like 'freedom' and 'family') and not to question motives.<br /><br />'Strip Search' is a deliberate attempt to throw the light of reality into this collective 'un'consciousness.<br /><br />The storyline involves parallel stories of two people being detained in custody: an American woman in China, and a Middle Eastern man in the US. By using almost exactly the same dialogue, we are shown how to think outside the usual spectrum, and to feel compassion for both people. Without the twin story of the American woman, people would undoubtedly walk away from this feel feeling a lot differently.<br /><br />The acting is astonishing. One feels that this film meant more than just another job to the actors involved. I admire them immensely for their efforts.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will change a few minds, and that as a result - the world might become just that little bit better.",unsup

An example of how TV/Film can be used as a tool to get us to think and look at our world, our times and ourselves. --- BRAVO! and thank you to all involved in this project.<br /><br />The cast, the direction, the script, the crossover dialogue between the two interrogation all worked for me. And the choice of using nudity? How could they have done it otherwise? It really hit home the humiliation and terror of such practices. A somewhat prophetic piece in light of recent events and the exposure of America's tactics in Iraq.<br /><br />I highly recommend that people not only see it, but talk about it.

A previous comment titled ""Duh"", at first glance, makes us all seem as though we are somehow keenly aware that civil rights are being denied...in America. But until I saw this movie, I couldn't parallel being arrested, tortured, and denied access to any outside help in China, to the same thing happening here. Somehow, the idea of these things taking place here didn't seem so terribly awful, and fearful, until I put myself in both of the actors roles as victim.<br /><br />Strip Search is one of the best, thought provoking movies I have ever seen.

10401_0,This movie was quite a profound piece of work. It involved a very unique process of film making in which the same screenplay was used to tell two different stories. This process is supposed to invoke in the viewer that the viewer shows sympathy for one character but not for another. When I watched it I consciously knew that it was the same words being spoken but then yet I did not understand why I felt sympathy for one character but not for the other speaking the same words. This is a very good movie to watch in the post 9/11 world in which the way America treats the rest of the world. Quite frankly I believe Americans(I being one of them) do not treat the rest of the world with enough respect and we disregard any of their thoughts. This movie shows the American viewer how a foreigner might see America. This movie totally blew me away. It is dumbfounding.,unsup

10405_0,"A simple movie but executed with style and a flair of direction has exalted this to a cult status along with the Alien. Predator is infused with elements of sci-fi, horror, and action adventure and primarily is the sole reason why it is still a beloved among hard-core action fans. The inclusion of mega star Arnold Schwarzenegger and vivid supporting casts definitely adds to that.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is that there is hardly a single dead moment in it. Every scene builds on the previous one and raises the stakes; keeping the pace of the film on its momentum. The tension is initiated there among the characters once they discover the wreckage of the crash and the gruesome sight of the dead body in the tree. The fear of the unknown has begun and sustains throughout their hunt.<br /><br />Not many films can capture such a rich tapestry of action, suspense, comedy and just plain old popcorn fun in one film. The special effects at that time were top notch and well deserved of the Oscar nomination and even today it still has the contemporary look and feel. The atmosphere of the film sets it apart from the other action oriented by being unpretentious and accepting at face value that this is purely action driven.<br /><br />The ultimate display of creativeness of vivid imagination from the effects crew is the Predator when revealed in full glory. A sight to behold! The imagery has now become an instant classic in similar veins that did for the Alien creature.<br /><br />Downright, the Predator is a thriller that entertains while being slick and fun with rousing tension.",unsup
10406_0,"John Mctierman and company have laid claim to the word 'Predator'. They have created the ultimate hunter/killer roaming the universe looking for worthy prey and this time it's Arnold (Dutch), and his able military team. This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey. Bit by bit it is revealed to us until it's full horror is unleashed in the climatic scene.<br /><br />The casting of this movie is near perfection, except for Shane Black who was offered a bit part when he was not needed for screenwriting duties. Arnold is the ultimate screen superhero. He is seemingly invincible and his overbearing confidence makes his casting as a leader natural. His muscles, thick austrian accent and powerful name have helped him permanently claim roles as his own - Conan, the Terminator and of course this one. Without Arnold in the sequel, it was always going to pale in comparison. For the screen superhero it was obligatory to have an adversary from outer space. Only in this way was Arnold going to have to use all that he had to overcome the invader. This is the match - up that moviegoers will want to see - the world's superhero trying to save us from a threat from outer space. Although this sounds reminiscent of the 40's and 50's when Hollywood capitalized on people's fears of a threat from outer space, this movie far transcends those B grade movies.<br /><br />His crack unit is composed of some of the most outlandish characters the action genre has to offer. There is Jesse Ventura, the loud and attention seeking ex - professional wrestler. His gun says it all - everything is over the top with him. Sonny Landham is the indian with a sixth sense. It is this contribution that adds to the movie's suspense - he senses the Predator and quickly comes to realize that the team is up against something stronger than them. This unnerves the others since Billy is always the calmest and is able to access the enemy and give his team the advantage. Then there is of course the seasoned screen professional, Carl Weathers. He is always in top physical condition and this along with his smoothness, is ideal for his role as the ex - ops boy who becomes a collar and tie agent - a job that requires different values and he now uses the men he used slog in the trenches with. This grouping together of such strong personalities must have created a very competitive atmosphere which would have translated into better performances. Notwithstanding this fact John Mctierman must have had a big balancing act on his hands.<br /><br />Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman. His creation embodies all one could imagine that the alien predator could have. It has missiles, spears, blades as talons, camouflage, infra - red eyesight and can deftly move within any environment. Of particular note is how the predator looks. It is the personification of our nightmares. Our fears tend to exaggerate our monsters and they are endowed with unnaturally long claws, glaring evil eyes, excessive mandibles ending with unusually long teeth and they are of immense size and strength. This is spawned by Stan in his alien predator creation. Undoubtably he is the man best able to create these monsters that haunt us at night.<br /><br />Although there are scenes that remind you of the 70's slasher flicks, it is never done for the sake of it. These scenes show us how deadly the predator is and how it can swiftly attack and disappear without trace. The fact that highly trained team members are being killed in this way makes the rest feel vulnerable to the point of cracking. Unlike these slasher films the acting is better, no - one is helpless and these scenes fit into the story and are not the excuse for it.<br /><br />The climatic encounter is fantastic. Dutch uses all his capabilities to overcome the predator, but when facing his end the predator sizes him up as an opponent worthy enough to face unarmed. It had found a prey that by facing in unarmed, pure combat, it would prove itself as the true warrior. It's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it's undoing since it affords Dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention is the powerful military soundtrack thus setting the tone for a meeting of two great forces where one will stand and one will fall.<br /><br />",unsup
10407_0,"'You know bro' whoever did this to you is gonna' comeback, and when he does I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him. I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him.'<br /><br />If you find yourself struggling to find a good sci-fi action pick this weekend on your weekly trip to Dave's Video or wherever the hell it is you rent your movies from, allow me to make a suggestion. Why don't you try renting an Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 classic, Predator. I mean you cannot go wrong with that.<br /><br />This is a movie I watch maybe once or twice a year. It has a few signature '80s action movie touches. There are the one-liners, all pretty good and every body seems to shoot from the hip. Also there seems to be a lot posing oil handy, which is a good thing I suppose as our team of skilled commandos just can't seem to keep their shirts on. Director John McTiernan wanted us to know, to have absolutely no doubt, that our heroes were absolutely, 100% badass. Well trust you me, we get the bloody picture. The films '80isms are not excessive though, and on the whole a little bit charming.<br /><br />Predator is a sci-fi flick that starts out as if it were going to be nothing more than a standard action film. (I must admit there is a neat little scene in the beginning that lets you know that it won't be) It begins with the arrival of a crack rescue team at a tropical U.S. military installation in dark bodied Hueys. The team is lead by a man we will know only as Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenenegger). The arrival of the rescue team is truly great film-making. The scene essentially establishes the intrinsic toughness of our heroes and their cohesiveness as a team of shooters. They arrive on the island and man they walk like the own it. They don't talk. They move like a highly coordinated unit, speech is unnecessary for men such as these, they know what they are supposed to do, they almost know each others thoughts. These guys have been together for years. And we the viewer understand all of this from just few quite scenes and remarkably good acting. It's all in the blocking of the shots and the carriage of the actors and it is all perfect.<br /><br />The teams mission: save three U.S. diplomats whose chopper has been shot down. Dutch thinks to ask why this Cabinet Minister's chopper was traveling on the wrong side of the border. 'They got off course.' Says Gen Phillips. The diplomats also seem to be carrying information mighty sensitive to the CIA, because Dutch and his team are going 'in country' under the authority of a guy named Dillon (Carl Weathers). He is an old friend of Dutch's but our hero is a bit uneasy about having his authority pulled out from under him. Dutch even delivers the most famous of 80's action hero lines, well a variation of it anyway. The line typically goes something like this, 'I always work alone.' In Predator the line is, 'My team works alone.'<br /><br />This is all standard action movie stuff. Well done to be sure but still material we have all seen before. What is great about this stuff though is how well done it is. The movie was filmed some where in South America, and it looks like they are moving through a real jungle. This is jungle with a capital J. They are not on a soundstage and that adds a lot to the movie. It is also during this material that we see that there may be more in store for them than just guerrillas. I won't say what they find, but it is unsettling. The other thing that is established during this material is the way the team is really one unit. Everyone is important. During the rescue operation for instance, while we see them dismantling their opposition the camera doesn't just follow Arnold around, but it kind of keeps a running tab on all members of the team. My only real problem with these scenes is the way everyone is always shooting from their hips all the time. I mean it is okay for Blain (Jesse Ventura) he is carrying a big gatling gun, but everyone else? Come on! Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />The rescue doesn't go as planned, and instead of affecting the rescue (the 'diplomats' are dead), they pick up a prisoner, Anna (Elpidia Carrillo), and have to hike twelve miles to their extraction point. It is at this point that things begin to go terribly wrong for our heroes. The team's skill at killing has attracted the attention of different kind of hunter. And one by one he begins to pick them off, until finally there is just the Predator, and Dutch. Moreover it is a Dutch with out many of his modern weapons. He has his knife, a couple of rounds from is grenade launcher, but no launcher, and his wits. This is classic stuff.<br /><br />The showdown between the Predator and Dutch is quite a pay off. It is a tense game of cat and mouse, with the roles of hunter and hunted changing more than once. Predator is maybe not a great action-sci-fi movie, but it certainly is one of the most fun. Rent it and enjoy.",unsup

That is a pity because they could have had for once a documentary about kids finding their way rather than losing themselves but the filmmaker went rather with the caricatural: -the genius overachiever (the good) -there's the tortured teenager (the bad) -the 9 year old twins who would not know what a beat (or singing in tune) is if it came up and hit them in the head (the comic relief) -the school director who spends his time screaming and berating these kids like it's boot camp time in full metal jacket (bare in mind these kids are between the ages of 9 and 17)- (the ugly) - Even after their triumph at the Zappa fest you don't see him once high five a kid or give him or her a compliment.

10411_0,"Predator. Possibly the greatest monster movie ever made. I'll explain why. Having just wrote a mini dissertation on the film, i think i stand in good terms to give my opinion on this film. First of all, the plot to the film is quite complex. Dutch and his band of commando's are brought to a military base somewhere in south America, where they are given orders to rescue a team of cabinet ministers who have been captured in foreign territory. This is in fact a ruse, as Dillon, Dutch's former team member who now works for the CIA, actually wants Dutch and his team to go in and destroy a guerilla terrorist camp who have vital government information. Dutch, unaware of the hidden agenda accepts and the team, including Dillon are whisked of to the drop site (somewhere in south America). So, the film starts off with the genre of Action Adventure film. This quickly changes however with the introduction of the predator. It has no physical presence in the film at first, it just takes the role of observer. John McTiernan (director) created a stroke of genius when he let us see through the predator's eyes. This is where the genre of horror is added to the film as the monster stalks them from the trees.<br /><br />As the film progresses Dutch becomes less trusting of Dillon as situations arise that don't fit Dillons story. Eventually, they reach the guerilla camp and so ensues a great action war sequence. The commandoes take over the base and Dutch quickly realizes that he and his team been set up by his own government. he challenges Dillon about it who admits that they had been set up, but says that they were the only people who get the job done. The scene between Dutch and Dillon is quite intense and this adds to the tension of the movie. They decide that its time to leave and begin their march to the pick up site. This is where the Predator makes a full introduction into the movie as one by one he picks off the members of the team. It's classic horror as each time the creature takes out a member, he reveals himself a little more. Each death scene becomes more elaborate as the film progresses. The remaining members of ther team try to mount a fightback, but to no avail. The monster kills of the last members of the team, predictably leaving a showdown between itself and Dutch. This is a great section of the film as the predator is finally revealed in all its glory. Dutch realises on escaping the monster that he can camouflage himself using mud and this sets up a interesting finale. They battle for a while using weapons until it eventually comes down to Man against monster. The scene where the Predator takes off the mask is one of the best in movie history. Stan Winston did a great job on designing the monster and it shows in the final scenes. The death of the Predator results in a mini-nuclear explosion which is a little unrealistic (as is Blain's ability to hold a mini-gun and all the ammo needed to fire it). At the end Dutch emerges from the jungle as the only survivor and is picked up by a military helicopter. The end to a great film. The film works because of it's multi-genre definition. It's a Action, adventure, sci-fi, horror, thriller, war movie with elements of western genre mixed in as well. its narrative structure is extemely complex. trying to apply Propp, Toderov and Branigan to it is difficult but do-able. The film is excellently directed, masterfully shot, with great detail given to camera angles, point of view shots and special effects. The Predators camouflaged effects are magnificent and add greatly to the mystery surrounding the creature. The cast all act very well and gell cohesivley. Schwarzenegger is surprisingly believeable as Dutch and this doesnt feel like just another Arnie flick. All in all its a great monster movie and easily competes with the likes of Alien. In my opinion it's a better film than Alien. It takes place on earth, so the threat seems more real. I could go on for ever about this film, but instead, I'll leave it there and wait for someone to reply with their view. Chris Tunstall (aka trickflipper)",unsup

10413_0,"One of my favorites!<br /><br />John McTiernan at his best. I first saw this film back in '88 and it scared the hell out of me. Partly in due to its suspenceful plot and visual effects, and the fact that I was only eight years old in 1988.<br /><br />Recently reviewing the ""Special Edition"" version released in 2002, on Region 2 DVD format. The two-disc DVD package of ""Predator : Special Edition"" is the most current up-to-date version of the film. Disc 1 features the theatrical release of the film in 1:85:1 aspect (enhanced for 16x9 screens). A rather dull but interesting commentary by John McTiernan, as well as interesting text commentary. Subtitles in 14 different languages, and an easter egg. Disc 2 features some excellent stuff such as featurettes, trailers, documentaries, etc. Interesting stuff!!<br /><br />""Predator"" begins in the fashion of ""Aliens"", space! But quickly changes to the classic Arnie like war flick (anything before 1987), and even resembles aspects of the second Rambo film. The Plot : Arnold and his team of special forces are hired by CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue American hostages deep in the Central American jungle. While all seems to go well and is looking good, WE begin to see what something else SEES (which for an eight year old was a little freaky). The team is being watched from the trees by something invisible.<br /><br />The team reaches the village where the hostages are being kept, they quietly blow it to pieces only to find out that they were setup by one of their own. Pissed off, Arnie & team decide to leave without a trace, or should I say a trace of their own words. WE begin to see (through its own infrared heat imaging vision) that something is stalking them.<br /><br />As the team is trying to get to their pick up point they are being killed one by one be something unknown, and unseen.......... I'll leave the rest up to you!!!<br /><br />""Predator"" is a classic popcorn film, and one of the best action films of the Twentieth Century. It was the film that turn Arnold into a plausable actor. A fine performance by Kevin Peter Hall (he will be missed). My only wish that didn't come true is for a better sequel, that is a different story.",unsup
10414_0,"When I first saw this film I had the feeling something completely new was achieved by the film maker. An Action Sci-fi movie with action scenes that are believable (humanly possible) but still with a mysterious, powerful alien that is slowly developed from a computer generated wispy creature to a real and frightening being. Yes, the alien has superhuman strength, abilities and equipment but remains believable. Yes, Arnold rolls his muscles but not too explicitly as in some of his other movies, besides he needs them all in the physical fight against the alien who is very clearly a size too big for Ernie. In summary, a fast, innovative Action Sci-fi movie so full with small detail that you can see it time after time and still discover something new.",unsup
10415_0,"Being fully dependent to technology is a weakness. That's what Dutch and the predator learned. At the beginning, the human team made mistakes that cost many lives. Leaving all the human-made weapons and becoming one with the Nature wasn't a choice, it was an evidence.It was a better idea to focus on efficient use of raw materials than wasting time with predictable guns. Once Dutch understood the trick, the predator began to reproduce these mistakes. Dutch became invisible and the predator tried to blast everywhere as if he was blind by his confidence on his technology. To sum up my ideas : Nature vs Technology, Unconsciousness vs Rationality, Confidence vs Fear. To conclude, i would say that Dutch finally reached his distant ancestors' primal instincts for hunting and survival that made the human race competitive on the natural selection. As my title said, Dutch has gone back to the basics.",unsup
10416_0,"Yeah, I know this is a low-grade simple story, one of those action flicks that oozes with too much testosterone.....but so what.? Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle. I don't know anyone who ever dozed asleep watching this, so it's not all bad. It's actually a fun movie.<br /><br />Despite the moronic and unlikeable characters who uttered some stupid dialog, the movie gets you very involved and is one of the better pure-action movies I've ever seen. The jungle scenery is outstanding to view on DVD. This is a pretty movie for such low-grade material, story-wise. I watched it a second time just for the visuals.<br /><br />The ending, with Arnold Schwarzenegger battling the alien, goes on too long.

A Hunter from another world!<br /><br />My Spiel: This movie is absolutely one of my favorites. From a time I watched this movie for 3 straight months, for every day. Some days I watched it more then once. I had this on a terrible VHS tape. But for some reason having to rewind it and in the rewinding time span I wanted to watch it again and again. This movie is full of everything from blood/guts/bullets/knifes/aliens/war/soldiers/death. All those mix to make the true ""Guy Movie"". Granted this movie has it's flaws but come on, this is one of those ultimate badass movies where none of that crap matters. There have been tons of movies to try to duplicate this movie and all fail. I can't urge people enough to just watch this for what it is. The ultimate what the hell else could go wrong for a special elite team lead by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). That has already been tricked into doing a job, also in 115+ degree heat, and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces. From the attack on the base camp that they completely demolish, to the destruction of a square block of jungle with the mini gun scene. But this movie true message is the fact that Dutch is left to fight the Predator without the use of military weapons, but has to make his own out of the supplies and natural surroundings around him, which completely throw the Predator for a complete loop, or does it!<br /><br />After screening this movie to many times to count I have come up with a conclusion about the end. I believe that Poncho (Richard Chaves) the soldier with the automatic grenade launcher, Survived at the end. Well I believe he was in the lap of Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) in the helicopter at the end. Because you can see the hair of someone laying down but no face. And the only one with that short of hair at the time was Poncho, and heck I think Anna came back for him, granted he did get hit by a huge log, but who the hell else could it be. Also on another note in ""Predator 2"" they talk about only two special mission force members survived and I don't know what this means to you, but Anna is no special forces member! This is truly something that has bothered me for some time. But this movie had given me days of satisfaction and a must watch for anyone who likes Sci-fi/Horror/Action.

10418_0,"Having not being born when Predator came out, the first I heard about any sort of Predator was the Alien vs. Predator franchise. Therefore I was never too bothered about seeing this movie. And what I was missing out on! I want to start by saying that this is, alongside The Terminator (also staring Ah-nuld Schwazenegger) this is probably the action movie of the eighties. Nothing comes close to the suspense and pure brilliance of this film. The Predator and the lack of it visually creates a genuinely terrifying antagonist who ruthlessly butchers his way through Ah-nuld's elite squad. Ah-nuld himself is brilliant as Dutch, the ripped leader in a film strewn with brilliant one-liners (knock knock!), Ah-nuld was perfect for the role as someone fighting on the side of good rather than the evil monster-type role.

And he got way more than he bargained for with the Predator.<br /><br />Before his crowning achievement of Die Hard, John McTiernan assembled a group of seven muscle-bound commandos in the South American jungle and let them unleash hell on Latino, Russian and Aliens alike with an awesome arsenal of macho weaponry. This is definitely a boys' movie. Both Alien and Aliens - hell, even Friday The 13th - had a thing about two females going head to head at the end. How are us guys supposed to get a kick out of endings like that? Arnie plays Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, the leader of an elite Spec Ops force. His team is called to duty by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and the very suspicious Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue a bunch of government officials, who have been shot down in enemy territory in Latin America.<br /><br />As soon as they arrive in the jungle something is watching their every move from the trees. And they get the feeling that things just ain't right. The first rescue team is found disembowelled and skinned. Same goes for their chopper.<br /><br />None of them trust Dillon. He's up to no good. There are no cabinet ministers being held hostage, just a bunch of his CIA pals being tortured by the Russians. In no less than five minutes, all seven of them completely obliterate a rebel guerrilla camp. The CIA hostages are dead.<br /><br />Dutch is angry and feels mighty betrayed. Dillon lied to him and their mission is over as soon as it started. All they have to do is make a journey through one valley to the nearest rendezvous point and fly back home. Not so simple when a high-tech, seemingly invisible, 7'2'', extra-terrestrial Rastafarian hunter is picking them off one by one and keeping their skulls as trophies. This predator is obviously a fan of the 1932 movie, The Most Dangerous Game.<br /><br />In the same way that he created nervous claustrophobia around the Nakatomi Plaza in Die Hard, McTiernan floods the movie with an oppressive and twitchy atmosphere. Half of the film's ominous tone comes from Alan Silvestri's militaristic and primeval score, with pounding drums and lurking strings, indicating that the Predator's haunting presence is everywhere. He could strike from any corner at any moment. And he does.<br /><br />Nothing Dutch and his men seem to do can thwart this enemy and in no time at all Dutch is the last one standing. He runs for his life with the Predator in hot pursuit.<br /><br />The final act is no doubt the strongest and can even be viewed as a separate movie altogether. McTiernan ditches the lush, steamy jungle from the first two acts and completely turns it around into a strikingly Gothic, baroque, supernatural landscape. There is a subtext of primitive brutality winning over highly advanced super-weapons. And there is enough testosterone between Dutch and the Predator to fill 100 tanker trucks. Women, totally, need not apply.<br /><br />Definitely one of Arnie's best and a landmark action movie. No doubt. Outdone only by the sequel.<br /><br />Note: When the Predator rises out of the lake and tries to locate Arnie, who is covered in mud, he notices a monkey sitting on a log. Freeze frame the film when he zooms in and you will see a single frame shot of a man in a white vest with an explosion/lens flare behind. It looks like a shot from Die Hard (which wasn't made at the time!) and I have no clue how it got in there.<br /><br />Weird huh?",unsup
1041_0,"I have an unnatural bias against this film. First off, Paul Green is one of the worst people that I have ever met, and this documentary falsely glamorizes him as some sort of savior of rock & roll. Wrong. Paul Green is a failed musician, who got a good idea in his head. And even though I believe that his teaching methods should be classified as child abuse and should be thrown in prison, the idea worked. You may wonder, why do I have such a strong hatred for the guy, well, here's a little back story.<br /><br />I was a student at Rock School for year when I was 13 and was the subject of much derision and psychological abuse from both other students and Paul himself. I only stayed for a year, because I learned a lot of my guitar teacher Nate, and enjoyed playing with the other students who didn't hate me. Fast forward 4 years later, after seeing this film, and looking for work in the music business, I got the chance to co-direct a show for the school, and for all the hard work I put into that, was (methaphorically) thrown under the bus by the institution.<br /><br />As for the film. I was definitely excited at first, but after being back in the belly of the beast and being treated so horribly, I curse this film and the subject.<br /><br />However, I certainly give all the props in the world to the kids who can stomach Paul and his despicable actions, and yet come out of it with a great talent. And I do have the deepest respect for my peers from my time at Rock School who have successfully developed their talents, and gone on and become successful. As for Paul, go f--- yourself.",unsup
10420_0,"*Possible spoilers*<br /><br />""Predator"" is arguably the best of the '80s/early '90s action bonanzas. Well-conceived, psychologically taut, visually vibrant and deeply entertaining, it has aged remarkably well. <br /><br />The direction, screenplay, special effects, and general production values of ""Predator"" are just as muscular and confident as its cast. Even when the movie slips into excess (which it frequently does, with gratuitous flexing, absurdly over-the-top firefights, and unabashed macho banter), it does so with such a boisterous swagger that you can't help but hop on for the ride. This is film-making at its most self-assured and unapologetic. Director John McTiernan has said he set out to make a classic popcorn movie, and he succeeded in spades.<br /><br />The story is surprisingly thematically strong, and believe it or not, it owes that to the depth of Schwartzenegger's character--a monster-movie hero who's actually on par with the monster. Every action hero has to have his requisite humanizing moments--it's par for the course. Smiles at a kid, saves a puppy, blah blah blah. But Dutch's are more effective than any other instances I can think of because they are so believable and unforced. ""I don't do this kind of work,"" Dutch says indignantly after he learns his team (""We are a rescue team, not assassins."") has been duped into attacking a rebel camp on the pretense of rescuing hostages. It's really a great moment--a simple, unexaggerated statement of ethics--as tough as Dutch and his team look, they derive real pride from the fact that they are in the business (primarily) of saving lives rather than ending them. It's not shoved in our faces, we don't have to watch Dutch cradling a tattered child's doll in the wreckage or anything--it's just there. This crucial humanizing moment makes Dutch's struggle with the Predator all the more striking--he has to give in to that part of himself that he rejects early on in the movie: the aggressor, the killer, the hunter, the savage. He has to allow this part of himself to take over in order to survive. <br /><br />The ensemble cast deserves kudos, too (especially Bill Duke in the performance of a lifetime as the smoldering Mac)--the film is much deeper and richer thanks to their spirited characterizations. We ACTUALLY CARE when these guys (who would be called ""side characters"" in most other action movies) are picked off by the malicious demon that hunts and haunts them. Again, the characterization is effective and feels genuine, which lends greater meaning to the central action of the movie. As screen writing formulas go, this is definitely not rocket science, and most action and horror films attempt it in some form or fashion, but surprisingly few do so successfully.<br /><br />And, of course, the other star of ""Predator""--the creature itself, is masterfully conceived and designed, both with and without the mask. It still stands (along with, yes, the Alien) as one of the coolest and most imaginative monsters ever put on film.<br /><br />This is a very important movie to people (especially guys) of my generation--I remember re-watching it repeatedly when I was ten or eleven (probably too young!), totally fascinated and drawn in to the primal story of kill-or-be-killed. I can honestly say that this appeal has not dwindled one iota. If, like me, you grew up on ""Predator,"" I highly recommend picking up the new DVD so you can see for yourself how well it has stood the test of time. If you haven't seen it and have any respect for action films or thrillers whatsoever, check it out.",unsup
10421_0,"Back in a time when the term ""popcorn movies"" actually meant something, Predator stands out especially today, mostly due to its high quality writting and top notch action. This movie never gets boring, as we watch the characters interact with each other, it brings to mind the feeling I got when watching the Marines from Aliens; a great feeling of comradary and gruff friendship. The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy ""futuristic"" effects we are seeing today. The Govenator is perfect for the lead role in this film, he commands a certain respect both from the characters and audience alike.<br /><br />The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards. The filmakers knew how to use the Predator makeup, they shadow it in as much darkness as possible, cover it in mudd and grime, which hides what could have been very obvious makeup ""guy in a suit"" effects. The guy who plays Predator did everything he could to add some life to the creature, to make people think he could stand up against Arnold in the end. Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.<br /><br />As we watch the downfall of summer ""popcorn"" movies, its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.",unsup
10422_0,"Some will tell you ""Predator"" is another dumb '80s action flick. It's not. It's very different from anything else Arnold Schwarzenegger has starred in. First of all it begins as a standard Military war film, setting up the plot for about 45 minutes! It then morphs into a suspense-thriller/sci-fi film: Like some sort of Agatha Christie novel meeting ""Rambo"" via ""Aliens."" It's quite intelligent and thrilling, not revealing the Predator creature fully until the very end. Part of the reason this film works, and the sequel does not (as successfully anyway), is the level of suspense and mystery surrounding the Predator.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers one of his best performances as Dutch. Granted, he isn't required to do much more than shed his upper-body clothing and look ripped, but he _does_ do more than that - I felt sympathy for Dutch, he seemed like a realistic character, and I forgot that I was watching Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has a few good one-liners (""Stick around!"" being the cream of the crop along with ""Knock knock!"") but especially later in the film, his confidence stumbles and he turns into the flip-side of the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action hero.<br /><br />The sequel worked as a comic-book-style creature feature but the original ""Predator"" is a much better film than most people give it credit for, being the rare smart action film that is solidly constructed and worth watching far more than just once.",unsup
10423_0,"In 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was solidifying his position as an action superstar with the releases of the epic Conan, the influential Terminator and the somewhat mediocre Commando that was still fun to watch anyway. However, that position wouldn't be fully cemented until the arrival of Terminator 2 in 1991 which forever raised the bar for the action genre. <br /><br />But plain and simple, ""Predator"" is a staple for Schwarzenegger's profile. It introduced the ultra cool ""Predator"" to the world and changed the popular culture's perspectives on alien movies. But the movie itself isn't just known for the central character, like the crappy Friday the 13th movies that are only known for the murderous Jason Voorhees and his stupid hockey mask. But ""Predator"" is known for the movie as a whole, with a great simplistic plot, awesome characters and great action that will make people want to see this again and again.<br /><br />The movie is a about a former soldier/mercenary named Dutch (Arnie) who has been involved in a lot of conflict and has since decided to settle down and be the leader of a rescue team. He goes to a South American country to participate in a mission that would supposedly rescue a Cabinet Minister and a few other hostages, but later on he finds out that he's been set up and it was actually a mission to destroy a rebel base that would've invaded sooner or later. And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle, but they're then being pursued by an alien who ""hunts"" rather than kills. As the situation escalates, Dutch starts to lose his sanity and that's totally evident in the final showdown with the creature.<br /><br />Like James Cameron's ""Aliens"" that came out the year before, ""Predator"" is shaped by it's excellent characters, Dutch is the great, silent leader who is somewhat broken inside from all the combat that he went through in the past and his quote ""If it bleeds, we can kill it"" is among the greatest. Blain is the totally cool tobacco-chewing, mini-gun-totting guy who spewed out 2 of the movie's best lines: ""I ain't got time to bleed"", and ""This stuff'll make you a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus, just like me"". Mac is pretty much Blain's best bud and frequently shaves with his razor and without the shaving cream to show his manliness. Hawkins is the super-nerd of the group who reads comic books and occasionally makes some sick jokes about his girlfriend. Billy is the silent, no-nonsense spiritual dude. Dillon is the dirty CIA agent who was best pals with Dutch a few years back and then sets up Dutch and his team, which leads to their demise and his, as well. And finally, Poncho is the sympathetic, yet sarcastic soldier who connects with Anna, their hostage, during the course of the film. And these guys are great characters; and they each have their own personalities, which makes you want to see more out of each guy.<br /><br />And of course, I can't forget about the ""Predator"". The high-tech alien that hunts other creatures for sport was a very creative and original idea. It also held a very intimidating presence and the special effects were very well done, especially the camouflage. And I'm still wondering how that managed to do that in 1987.<br /><br />And last, but not the least, the action really stands out thanks to the direction of John McTiernan, who directed this right before he made ""Die Hard"". The scene when the team attacks the rebel camp is, without a doubt one of the best in cinema, since it shows each team member providing something in the attack, and it's not just one guy who acts like a one-man army and destroys everything in his path all by himself. Also, Dutch's confrontation with the predator at the end, which displays more prehistoric styles of combat with the setting of the boulder and spike traps. And this movie makes up the modern warfare action and the caveman action so well.<br /><br />Any action/sci-fi junkie should watch this, and they will be HOOKED. And you will want to see this again and again.",unsup
10424_0,"""Predator"" is a genuine Classic. Action, Horror, Sci-Fi it's all there. Lets see for starters we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, on top form riding to the peak of his action status, leading a team of tough Commandos. Made up of a great cast including Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and Bill Duke. They're on a mission to rescue Hostages from Gorilla forces but are double crossed by the C.I.A, stop there and you already have a great action movie.<br /><br />But oh no, this film also has an Intergalactic Alien Big Game hunter equipped with plasma cannons, Stealth Invisibility and Thermal Vision. It would be so easy to imagine this film going nowhere if it where to have fallen into the wrong hands. You could really imagine a plot of an Alien hunting Commandos in the jungle coming off a bit lame but no, Fox thankfully had faith and McTierman had a vision. Fox's faith may have been down to there two previous unexpected big hits ""Aliens"" and ""Commando"" which you could possibly say this film is a hybrid of.<br /><br />Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously. One minute we see a fairly realistic use of of weapons and tactics the next Arnie throws a truck down a hill equipped with C4 and Jesse Ventura pulls out his M-134 Mini Gun and shreds some Gorillas.<br /><br />The Predator it's self is a classic design, thanks to the genius Stan Winston, and in my opinion never looked better than in this movie. It looked slightly fake in Pred 2(Not a bad film too) and don't get me started on the travesty that is AvP. It could have been a different story if they had stuck to the big rubber turtle they had shot scenes with thank god Arnold himself suggested Winston.<br /><br />I won't spoil the plot for anyone who's not yet seen it I just urge you to see this movie.",unsup
10425_0,"This film will always have special place for me, as aside from being one of the best horror/sci-fi films of the eighties; it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine. Despite the fact that I've seen it dozens of times as a kid, I have only seen it once during adulthood; and that single viewing was more than enough to remind me what it is that I love about this film! Predator works as a macho action film, gory horror and intriguing sci-fi, and despite it's short running time of just 100 minutes, it somehow manages to find room for all three. The fact that it stars action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger ensures that the film will always be favourably remembered. He's not a good actor, but Arnie always manages to bring that extra something to his movies. The plot is deliciously simple and follows a group of commandos that go off into the jungle on a secret mission. However, things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there. Finding the skinned bodies of the last group of men that entered the jungle is about to become the least of their worries...<br /><br />The jungle makes for a great setting for an action sci-fi flick such as this. These sorts of films tend to be set in space, so seeing the action down here on earth is different; and the fact that it's set in the jungle, with it's dense foliage, ensures that Die Hard-director John McTiernan is able to bump up the suspense, as just like in the Vietnam war; the soldiers are dealing with an unknown enemy. The atmosphere really is excellent, and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone, while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. Predator was released hot on the heels of the success of James Cameron's amazing 'Aliens' - but don't be thinking this film is merely a rip off following a trend, Predator has more than enough up it's sleeve to ensure that isn't the case. The action is great, and director McTiernan clearly knows what he's doing. It's fast and furious, and the amount of weapons on display ensures that the film is sure to delight fans of macho action films. The fact that the lead actor is a monster of a man doesn't exactly hurt the film either! <br /><br />Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger may well be a terrible actor; but it doesn't matter because it's his screen presence, not his acting ability, that makes his performances what they are. At times he's cringe-worthy, but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences, and that is all a film of this nature needs. Arnie isn't the only big man in the film either, as an assortment of muscle men, including ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, and Carl Weathers; Rocky's Apollo Creed, among other B-movie actors, join him. The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally, in the form of the movie's central alien. The Predator may not be as beautiful as the creature from 'Alien', but it's just as inventive. Here we have an extra terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed, or to 'phone home' - but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport! Aside from being ingenious, the idea also borders on frightening. The gore here is gratuitous, but never goes over the top and on the whole, Predator is a film that never really got the credit it deserves. It's mindless fun - but its damn good mindless fun!",unsup
10426_0,"Watching `Predator', which is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies, it becomes obvious why Arnold's recent return to action (`End of Days', `The Sixth Day) have all tanked at the box office. For some reason, Arnold's chosen to play men with a dark past in his recent films, men with a complex background . . . men with laughably bad backstories. His great characters - such as Dutch Schaeffer in `Predator' - have no background. It's not necessary. The second Arnold steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple. Not every moviegoers' cup of tea, to be sure, but it works. Unlike `End of Days' or `The Sixth Day', classic Schwarzenegger action films like `Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot. Predator is kind of a Zen-philosophy action film - the violence and cheesy one-liners just happen.<br /><br />`Predator' is a fairly simple story; it's essentially a sci-fi version of `The Most Dangerous Game.' A group of American soldiers, led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his rival Dillon (Carl Weathers), lead a full-blown assault on a group of South American revolutionaries. Carnage ensues. After wiping out said revolutionaries, an alien creature armed to the teeth with high-powered weaponry - the Predator - assaults the American soldiers. More carnage ensues.<br /><br />Hey, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but thoughtful, well-written action movies aren't exactly common. `Predator' works as an action movie - and as a darn good one - because it's kept simple (thus minimizing the plot holes and the head-scratching moments), it maintains a high level of excitement, action, and tension, and it's cool. Schwarzenegger is larger than life as Dutch, pure swaggering testosterone at its best. Jesse `The Body' rules as Blaine, Carl Weathers is icily cool as Dillon. . . and so on and so on. Enough sarcastic, macho one-liners and brutal firepower fill the movie to make it a male adolescent snapshot of tough-guy heaven. The Predator looks wicked as well - Stan Winston outdid himself, as the Predator does look and move like a vicious being from another world, and not just some stunt guy in a rubber suit. The direction by John McTiernan adds the final piece to the puzzle; the cinematography of the jungle is appropriately hot, steamy, and claustrophobic, and the quick pacing of the film moves rapid fire between all-out action and the tension of hunting one's prey . . . or being hunted. Everything adds up to a simple, streamlined, first-rate action movie.<br /><br />Again, not the most intelligent film ever made, but `Predator' is still quite good - it's probably Schwarzenegger's best pure action movie. (Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.) `Predator' is a lean, mean, intense action flick from start to finish. <br /><br />Grade: B",unsup
10427_0,"First of all, if you haven't seen this action, suspense and violence extravaganza, you most certainly are not a true action movie afficionado. The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest. Take note of Sonny Landham's comment;""there's something out there,and it ain't no man.<br /><br />The action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down. Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other. There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator). All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors. Very, very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.<br /><br />I shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potential/virgin viewers to find out for themselves.

10428_0,"Consider that so many of the roles that Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on are so similar, including Predator, and yet this film is so much better than most of the others. I enjoy watching his movies just because he's such a watch-able guy, even in his bad movies (which are many), but I think the thing that really makes Predator stand out is its simplicity. The movie starts, the guys get dropped in the jungle, lots of blood and carnage flies across the screen, and the movie simply ends. No romance, no complex back story, no soldier struggling with problems in his past or even trauma caused by the horrible things he experiences during the movie. This is one of the things that made First Blood so good. It may turn out to be a movie about a lot of muscle-bound meatheads in the woods, but it doesn't insult the audience or try to apply complexity to a story that can't support it.<br /><br />Interestingly, the movie features two eventual governors. Jesse Ventura even wrote a book which was released while he was the governor of Minnesota and he used his favorite line in this movie as the title. And the book's actually pretty interesting; there are some funny stories in it about things that went on while they were filming this movie. Arnold, on the other hand, is actually (and thankfully) given a relatively small amount of stupid one-liners, which are an idiotic byproduct of hard action movies that I've never really understood the necessity for. They don't reveal anything about the characters who say them, they don't add to the story or further the plot, and with rare exceptions, they're not funny. But I guess comic relief has to come from somewhere, and since complexity is not a requisite for movies like this, I can't really expect a lot of thought being put into the comedic content either.<br /><br />I watched Predator having never seen it from beginning to end and having just re-watched the original Alien. I am currently in the process of re-watching both series', for obvious reasons. One thing that I notice about both of them is the way they take their time in introducing the enemies which, in both films, are aliens. Predator doesn't waste much time dwelling on the origin of the alien, we pretty much assume it came from a space ship that flashed across the screen at the opening of the movie. Alien, on the other hand, went into remarkable detail about where its alien came from. What Predator does do, very effectively, I think, is that it has the guys fighting some very human enemies, which allows the movie to later take its sweet time in having them realize that the new enemy is not human at all. This is also, incidentally, weakly rehashed in the sequel, using the secrecy of this mission and team as an excuse to have more guys who don't know what's going on.<br /><br />The death scenes are actually pretty tasteful, given the genre. They are just gory enough to illustrate the violence of the enemy without being gratuitous. Just enough is shown to show how vicious the alien is, and there are some strange things done to and with the bodies that make you wonder about the alien's intentions or needs. The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual, but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his (or her) victims. Oddly enough, it is not until the awful Predator 2 that we learn that it kills for sport.<br /><br />Yes, the movie occasionally gets embarrassingly macho, but the skill with which it is put together far overshadows any tough-guy goofiness. Consider, for example, the ease with which the movie switches from showing the guys hunting the alien to their realization that they are the ones being hunted. In some cases, this transition takes place during a single shot and with virtually no movement in the shot at all except a change in someone's expression. It is truly a fight between a group of predators, which we understand because they are human like us, and a single predator whose powers and weaknesses are unknown. It's not Oscar material, needless to say, but it's a great action movie in part because it already knows that.",unsup
10429_0,"Predator is definitely one of the best alien thrillers ever made. It is one of my personal favorite movies. When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it. The Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall, is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s, when this movie was created. I like how humanlike its form is, and how un-humanlike it is at the same time. The creature's four mandibles were a great idea for its distinct facial characteristics and the creature's roar is awesome, one of the best ever produced. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidi Carillo, Shane Black, and Sonny Landham and they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today.

10430_0,"With the release of Alien Vs Predator i decided to watch the original Predator movie today. I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time. I think Predator 2 has a slight edge over this but Predator has a slight edge over Aliens BUT i think they are all extremely excellent films.<br /><br />Just in case you don't know, it's about a big alien whose race lives to hunt worthy prey and Arnold Schwarzenegger's team of commandos are that such prey. The commandos are sent into a South American jungle to find some missing airmen who are being held by guerrilla's. They do what they got to do which attracts the attention of the predator who is hunting in the area. So the predator goes and hunts the commandos with the aid of his kick ass weapons and cloaking device. The commandos also have a female prisoner.<br /><br />I think the whole sub-plot about the so called missing airmen isn't too important to the viewer but makes it possible for the commandos to be there. The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time. It is kind of spooky in a terrifying way as we don't see the predator properly for ages but see through his eyes which adds to the tension.<br /><br />The effects are great, the acting is OK and the story is cool too. I really like the music and especially the spooky twisted jungle sounds that we hear when we see through the eyes of the predator. This is a sci-fi action movie that isn't just full of cheap explosions. It really does have great atmosphere. Everyone who likes sci-fi and/or action movies should like this. If you don't then your taste in movies suck! This in my humble opinion is probably the second best sci-fi movie of all time.<br /><br />Alien Vs Predator has little of what made this so excellent so if you haven't seen Predator and thought AVP sucked don't think that this will. Predator is absolutely fantastic viewing. 10/10",unsup
10431_0,"Predator is the classic action film. What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved. The genius of that! The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end. He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see. Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy. The whole cast worked very well together. <br /><br />The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator. The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius. I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame. I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit. I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) <br /><br />Predator is evidence of how action films should be done. A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along. A timeless classic, one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />**** out of **** stars<br /><br />P.S. The 'forest massacre' scene is one of the funniest scenes in movie history!!",unsup
10432_0,"If this is the best that British television has to offer in the way of supernatural entertainment for the under-30 crowd (as it has been touted), then I must sadly report that their best is nowhere near good enough. The series: imagine ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" meets ""Charmed"" in the world of the movie ""The Prophecy,"" and you end up with this sophomoric piece of trash. Not even the very able and talented cast (Jemima Rooper especially) can save the thematic and plot line disasters that seem to lock this show into appealing to the lowest common denominator. Set at a posh English finishing school or college.<br /><br />I don't know if colleges in the UK have a student body set in an old estate in the middle of nowhere - where the food is plentiful and the traditionally bad fashion sense of the Brits abounds, dangly earrings, overdone makeup and all - but if they do, they seem like little more than high school with ashtrays. <br /><br />My problems don't revolve around the exceptionally linear themes or plots that you could drive a jumbo jet through sideways, nor around the alcohol, sex and drug abuse, or even the switch of leads from the first season to the next. I don't even have a problem with the so- called ""mythology"" of the series, based baggy-pants loosely upon biblical references to the Nephilim and Azazeal (which of course the series spells wrong). Those issues are there, but they are not what bothers me the most about Hex. <br /><br />I find that I cannot stand any of the characters. None of them have any redemptive value about them at all, and I keep hoping that they all die horribly at the end of each episode. All of them betray each other with casual nonchalance. All of them know the right thing to do in a given situation, and every single one of them does EXACTLY the opposite, for selfish reasons, and then expects everyone else to just understand that they are sorry, that everyone makes mistakes. <br /><br />Rife throughout the series is the idea that there is no free will. Time and again, every one of the characters sees what they should be doing, but feels helpless (or is just too stupid and weak) to make the correct choice in the situations. Maybe its just British melodrama (and if it is, please forgive me), but creating moral dilemmas that no person with an IQ above the average cretin would make is simply bad TV. <br /><br />The epitome of this nonsense is the proto-goth, heavy-faced heaven-aligned ""heroine"" of the second season who is having trouble deciding whether to kill the antichrist Malachi, or play kinky dress-up with him instead. Pathetic. <br /><br />As well, the initial idea that this is a moral play quickly falls to the wayside, as folk with knives, presumably secret passageways that run through the entire campus, bottles of herbal remedies (I kid you not), and an angelic artifact that looks suspiciously like a computer mouse are all that seem to move the plot along. One is left with the impression that this whole plot was built upon the idea of someone's live-action roleplaying game session. <br /><br />None of it truly makes sense, and at the end of the day, no one is worth saving. Honestly, I can see why this series was cancelled - there is no one to root for. I almost miss the wooden characterization of Azazeal. <br /><br />The writers and producers of the series all seemed to forget that the Fox series Millennium tried the whole 'end of days' thing, and once it happened, there was nowhere else to go. Hex is a one-trick pony, and I for one am so very glad to see it finally put down for the diseased and lame thing that it is.<br /><br />Were I a British viewer interested in seeing good supernatural drama on the telly, I would feel mightily insulted that the producers thought us stupid enough to swallow their garbage, all for the titillation of (un)intentional frontal nudity. Hex is essentially a pre-frontal lobotomy, set to bad mood music.",unsup

I couldn't find anyone who watched this miserable TV series who had a good word to say about it. Mind you, I'm 39 and most of my friends are of a similar age.

10434_0,"Where to begin? The fact the term ""Nephilim"", which actually means the offspring of Angels and humans, is used for the Fallen Angels themselves (correctly termed ""Grigori"")? Or howabout Thelma the Lesbian Ghost, who can't touch people, but can touch everything else, which includes opening doors, eating food, changing her clothes (and hair) and who casts a shadow? Then there's the fact that no one notices Cassie speaking to what would appear to be nobody at all, even when she's in a crowded room with people right next to her? And what the hell kind of high school is it where they allow male and female students to freely visit each other's rooms, unsupervised, and where teachers go to bars with the students? And what's the drinking age in England, anyway? I thought it was 19, but here we have high school juniors going to bars. And when Ella shows up, no one notices that she wears the same outfit every single day? But such details aside, nothing compares to the tedious, drawn-out, snail-paced storytelling style. Such a shame, too. This show had all the ingredients for being really good, but, I hate to say it, that dopey show Charmed was more exciting. And here I thought British TV shows were better than ours.",unsup
10435_0,"I am so sorry, after all of the online hype I REALLY wanted to like this. I was finally able to catch the first 7 episodes here in the states on BBC America & I was disappointed. The idea was there, even if it was ripped off from Anne Rice & her Mayfair witches, even the atmosphere and setting was pretty decent, and no one can really speak badly of Thelma. However I am a true fan of this genre and I have been spoiled by the high quality of the X-files and Buffy the vampire slayer. After experiencing what Chris Carter and Joss Wheden have given the world in paranormal storytelling I am appalled that this dreck could so easily satisfy so many. Hex is awful! The character's are not particularly interesting or sympathetic due to a severe lack of development - this blame can go on the writer's. It shouldn't be a welcome relief when a main character ""bites it"", as we say over here, however when Ella sticks it to Cassie we find ourselves really applauding a situation for the very first time in this show - SEVEN EPISODES IN! And I don't understand the casting of Michael Fassbender? Is he supposed to be ""sexy""? Where I come from he would be the last guy picked for sports! The term ""pencil-neck geek"" comes immediately to mind.<br /><br />This show left me bored and unimpressed, Thank God it only took two episodes of x-file reruns to make me forget most of this. It is offensive to us that this show would liken itself to Buffy or any of our paranormal/SciFi shows. When it comes to murder mysteries no one can hold a candle to the Brits. However the paranormal/SciFi genre is better left to the Yanks.",unsup
10436_0,"Hex is a one of the best programmes, need i say more, loved every minute of it, i just hope they make a third series as bot the first two series are fantastic, no sorry, MAGNIFICENT. It is one those programmes that you start to watch and can not get enough of as i said i hope they make a third series. Looking at this television it can be named in the same league as Buffy the vampire slayer in my opinion. When watching the programme you get a great sense of satisfaction from the storyline as is gets more intense as it goes along. first series gets the viewers to get a feel for the programme and teach important lessons about witchcraft and superstition. this makes the programmes great to watch with the feeling of something is around the corner waiting to come out and make you jump but not like a horror film. If i was to compare this with a film it would be the film from 2006 called 5ive Girls, this is a film based on witchcraft and has the same similarities to Hex.",unsup
10437_0,"When I first saw in the DVD shop I thought it would be a nice show like Buffy or Angel, but I was wrong... IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER! This show is perfect. The first few episodes it was a little slow (and I mean little) but it started to pick up speed and it snowballed and its just each breath-taking episode after each other now.<br /><br />There were so many themes and metaphors that I was impressed that they managed to include on a television program. This isn't a kids show (although it is safe). It makes you think and not just about the actual show, but about your own life and what you believe.<br /><br />Definitely the best show I have ever seen. It's like watching heaps of awesome movies after each other. I have laughed, cried and been incredibly shocked by this show. It is simply superb.<br /><br />I thought Angel and Buffy were good... they really don't compare to Hex. Each script, character, stunt, special effect, camera technique is done perfectly. The opening theme... I honestly can't describe how good this show is without raving.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by my enthusiastic answer either, I am very critical when it comes to film and television, I am a film maker myself. This show is way beyond its time and better then anything I have ever seen.",unsup

I do agree that without Cassie there is just something missing. We have really enjoyed the show thus far and are looking forward to seeing it next year, but will not be thrilled when the show comes to an end. would really appreciate anyone letting us know where we can get a copy of what am assuming the first season, it would be appreciated, or are we possibly a season behind here in the US? because Cassie died mid way here and from what I read, she was there for the first 2 seasons. <br /><br />Blessed Be Deb",unsup

When he was at the Zappalan festival, everybody was bowing to him at the end of his performance.<br /><br />Will, Asa, and Tucker also had potential in music.<br /><br />Paul Green is a really good teacher when you think about it.

10440_0,"This was an absolutely brilliant show, the character Azazeal had to be my favourite. Michael Fassbender is such a brilliant actor, and his good-looks kept me watching this show. However, after Azazeal leaves Malachi to fulfil his destiny on his own, i continued watching the show! I would definitely like another season to see what happens after the finale of the second season. I'm not at all religious, but the religious side of the story made the plot more interesting for me. I didn't particularly see Azazeal as truly evil, even though he was supposed to be. I mean, he was still like-able as a character despite the things he did.<br /><br />My least favourite character has to be Roxanne, she seemed like a dressed-up little tart only after one thing...sex! She was a waste of time and i'm glad she is killed off. This is one show that i'll definitely watch time and time again",unsup
10441_0,"The Brits have crafted a story that is compelling, interesting to look at, complete with the supernatural, and, with a shoe string of a budget, something quite believable. Hex, is a show of which I have seen three episodes on BBC America. Cassie, a startlingly unpopular girl at an English (either college or Prep School) has had some very strange dreams since she discovered a little piece of pottery hidden away in her room. It turns out, she's a witch, being pursued by an Angel named Azazeal, who wants to make beautiful music. Her best and only friend is her roommate Thelma, a dark-haired lesbian who is infatuated with her. The plot moves along at a moderate pace, with enough twists and turns and subtle effects that the very atmosphere of the show is compelling. Unlike the American Buffy the Vampire Slayer, character development is the most important piece of the show. I'm sorry to hear that the actress playing Cassie does not continue with the show in season two, and will be sad to see her go. Thelma, you will find out, is probably the most interesting character, after she is killed in the first episode by Azazeal. She becomes a ghost, who eats constantly, snoops about the castle, and even wanders into her classmates dreams for midnight rendezvous. The implications are delicious, as is this gem of a show.",unsup
10442_0,"The British Buffy? No. The British Charmed? No. Buffy meets Charmed? Very no. What is this need promoters have to compare a new show to established shows? Is it laziness? Well, it doesn't matter. It is true that there are some similarities between Hex and other supernatural shows, but they hardly bare comparing. The similarities for the most part between Hex and Buffy/Angel are, in my opinion, incidental. Ideas like demonic births, forbidden love, magic and the necessity to fight the paranormal with the paranormal is hardly a new premise. To assume that Hex got its ideas from already established shows does it a disservice because in the end, Hex is nothing like them.<br /><br />While Buffy/Angel and Charmed tend to rely on action to carry much of the story, Hex relies a great deal more on dialogue. This does not take away from the show but rather allows for the watcher to get to know the characters and to develop their own relationships with them. The show also is unafraid to hurt or even kill off main characters if the story warrants it. I believe this is important in a show. And since Hex has no title character it is possible to remove any character if the storyline demands it.<br /><br />Those who like shows such as Buffy because of the action might not enjoy Hex as much and might find it slow, but Hex is not the first show to carry the story through the characters and their relationships. Rather, I found that it made the story more real and interesting in some ways, especially since the majority of the characters are higher class snobs with the attitudes and personalities to match. At the same time, most of the main characters are round and dynamic. They grow and change and even the Annointed One has various depths to her character rather than being the typical self righteous do-gooder, whining teen who just wants to be normal or rebellious adolescent who either gets out of control or does what she wants because she can. There are stereotypes but they are less pronounced and most of the characters are sympathetic.<br /><br />I, for my part, enjoy the show. There are the occasional episodes or moments that don't bare watching, but every show that's ever existed has those moments. I for one enjoy watching it and am currently watching the show a second time. Those who are interested in action may not enjoy it but those who like to develop relationships with characters and see the change and growth in relationships and characters that seem fairly real probably will.",unsup

It is unfair to bring the U.S. this jewel to sci-fi/fantasy fans who fall in love with HEX, to then be disappointed by not producing a Season #3. Buffy is gone,Angel, Dead like Me, and Charmed, now this too!!! It is a travesty with all of the crap movies and TV that is produced to lose this show called Hex that is so refreshing in the land of crap TV such as One tree Hill, Pepper Dennis, and pretty much all of the other shows being produced for TV!!! I really want to stop falling for the shows that have cult followings. Legions of fans that the networks do not care about or listen to when they are asked to bring them back!!! Maybe we could petition the Sci-Fi network to stop making crap made for TV movies and help produce shows like Hex for true fans who would tune in worldwide!!",unsup

After the first episode I was hooked, tuning in every Sunday to see the next episode. In my opinion it is one of the best series on TV at the moment. It has humour, suspense, horror and can sometimes be plain shocking. Much darker than Buffy and seemingly made for a more mature audience it also deals with the problems of teenage life. A great program to watch on those dull Sunday evenings. Jemima Rooper is superb as Thelma and was easily my favourite character from the first episode. The characters are likable and can be very easy to relate to. You just don't see shows like this very often anymore and it is a real breath of fresh air. Bring on season three!",unsup

I've only seen the two episodes, but you can be sure I'll watch more.<br /><br />Where BtVS and Charmed may have dealt with some dark issues, they were in general light shows. Hex is a dark with light moments. From the very beginning, this show made it self stand out from the current supernatural shows simply because it's so dark. This is not a funny show, but a dramatic one that draws you in to watch the journey that Cassie must face. Though, I must say that as I saw the end of the episode, I declared a pure Joss Whedon moment - even if he had nothing to do directly with this show.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show, if you like British dramas and dark fantasies.",unsup

10447_0,"I started watching this show in '04. I watched the pilot and loved it. I like Cassie because she is just a typical teen in school. Few friends, not part of a big crowd but she wants it a lot. When she discovers her powers, things get interesting. She can move things without touching them, set things alight with her mind etc. But, her powers are part of the cause of her mate Thelma dying. Cassie has a love hate relationship with Azazeal leader a group of fallen angels. As the show progresses , Cassie becomes pregnant with Azazeal's child. The child grows at a quick speed. Cassie tries to terminate the birth but Azazeal manages to stop it. I turns out Cassie only had a C-section and gave birth to an evil son (born on Christmas day). In season 2 Ella arrives to kill the child but Cassie's feelings get in the way and she sacrifices herself for the child. The child ages about 16-18 years in 6 months! He takes over a school and plans to destroy the world. A good show if you want drama, comedy, a little action and romance with a lot of horror. 10/10",unsup
10448_0,"I really really enjoyed this show, especially the unpredictable way it took us through its dark Gothic set. Sure there is things that are not great, it feels a bit like the logic kind of jumps out the window from time to time, but that does not really matter! this show is about feelings(mostly sad ones) and about both avoiding and facing your destiny...<br /><br />**major spoilers ahead**<br /><br />True the first season were very different from the second one, but they had the same mood and theme. I liked the way Azazel and Cassie interacted in s.1 and the dark sense of a coming doom.. which do come, and facing her dark fate Cassie utterly fails, she dies giving way for our new heroine Ella. I liked this unexpected twist and how it affected the characters, this also makes the change in series 2 more warranted, with the Antichrist born and free the story arc about Cassie and her family history is not needed anymore, a bit sad and strange at first but it keeps the show much more interesting. I like the way Ella is far from perfect how she struggles and kind of fails and keep trying and fails again etc.. and how minor characters from earlier get bigger roles, especially Roxanne and Leon. When malachai appears (and he is a great Antichrist I must say) he seems less than happy about his role in the world.. he wants no part of his evil destiny, and also Ella seem to just wanna run away from her fate.. this unwillingness to abide to your destiny is a very interesting plot development I think, and is the whole Azazel-Cassie all over again but just a little different of course. Towards the end they both accept their fate to fight after a little help from heaven and hell (the question though, is who actually helped whom.. an excellent twist which runs through the whole show, almost no-one seems to be only good or bad, in the end everybody makes mistakes, even big ones, and everybody have strong feelings, and acting more or less selfish from time to time.) This changing in characters is the shows strongest (and sometimes weakest) point, I love it how everybody changes during the show but just feel that they change a bit too fast sometimes. Especially Thelma, who is the best character of the show, makes a lot of bad choices for selfish reasons.. but she also makes good ones, and like when it came to Amy, who can blame her? she has a very though fate indeed, facing a lot of sadness and only a little happiness.. I also like the sexiness of the show, it fits very well together with fallen angels, witches and the generally Gothic setting.<br /><br />Even though I really would like to see more I have trouble seeing what a 3rd season would be about, after all the evil won in the end, and the end of days came. True I am not completely happy in the way it ended. I like it that the bad guys won, they just were not clear enough about it, probably because they wanted to have some room for a third season, fir me just another 20-30 minutes to end it properly would do.. maybe just showing a scene of angels and demons battling each other in front of the burning school and Leon and Thelma hiding in the forest where we left them, crying of fear and failure over Ellas dead body.. and then suddenly meeting old friends (Cassie, Amy, Max, Roxanne, Tom, etc) and everybody then slowly goes away to heaven(or maybe hell) together (a semi happy ending, at least for our main characters getting the chance to meet and be together in the afterlife at least) A scene where Azazel, Raphael and Mephistopheles having a last drink together sitting quiet together seemingly contemplating their bitter and unhappy fates, of course with a close up on a tear falling from Azazels check before everything erupts into light/chaos, could be a kind of fitting/funny final scene <br /><br />anyway I really enjoyed this show. It was not completely logical, but in a way much more so than a lot of other series. With all the rambling above I basically just wanted to say that this is the best supernatural show out there with great interesting twists and turns. <br /><br />A lot of humor, attitude, sex, and cool music that fits the mood very well is also good reasons to see the show.",unsup
10449_0,"""Hex,"" more than any other show I can remember, plays for keeps. If henceforth all TV shows were this brave then TV would easily pass film as the most important artistic medium today. The problem is that TV depends too much on maintaining the status quo. Of course this problem has gotten better in recent years (and I'll happily give the credit to HBO), but still producers are too afraid to alienate their audience. Thus if you look back at any given show you will notice that very little changes from one season premiere to the next. The Desperate Housewives still live close by and Vince Chase still has his Entourage. My point being that ""Hex"" is not afraid of change. New characters replace old ones and nothing ever stays the same. If this season were a film instead of a TV show you would be hard pressed to find the lines between the episodes. We have also been trained to never believe a characters death (I'm looking at you ""Alias""), and because of that this show had the ability to legitimately rattle me, in a good way.<br /><br />The story is quite Harry Potter-ish. A student at a boarding school gains supernatural powers and is thrust into a battle between good and evil. The main difference being that our hero here, Cassie, is not all good and much better looking. Strong characters are established from the get go. Besides Cassie we also have Thelma, her lesbian ghost roommate. Jemima Rooper who plays Thelma is the star as she represents the moral center of the show. She is good-hearted, but defiant, sex crazed but unable to do anything about it. If I were to have a complaint about the show it would be the shorthand they use to distinguish between good and evil. The theory of the shows seems to be that only evildoers enjoy bodily pleasures such as sex and smoking. This line of thought is very Puritanical and I found it annoying. By the time the monsters showed up on campus I really wasn't very excited to see them. I wanted more of the relationship between Cassie and Thelma. I know the otherworldly stuff is why people tune in to a show called ""Hex,"" but in this case they didn't need it.<br /><br />If I were to find one theme from this season it would be that it sucks to be a girl in modern society because you are exploited for your body. We ca probably all agree that this world we live in is filled with evil. But being a guy I really have no concept of what it is like to have everybody I meet only be interested in having sex with me and my child bearing ability. These two things are the only things Azazeal wanted from Cassie. And because Cassie gave in to him she had to pay the price. This show is no masterpiece but it is darn good. The comparisons to ""Buffy"" are obvious, but this show is twice as good as that one. ""Buffy"" was a slave to the episodic nature of TV, whereas ""Hex"" sheds that skin and creates an experience that is nearly cinematic.",unsup

I found it pretty amazing what these kids are capable of as well as how this all seemed to come together by accident. Paul Green teaches his students with a great deal of passion and more importantly has the respect for both their ability AND their potential ability. How many kids get to share the stage with actual rock icons? Some people seem put off by the ""tough love"" thing that is part of the instruction but it seemed to me that the only time he got impatient was when it was obvious that certain kids weren't trying their hardest.

Thelma is also not a new face, she was is in the famous five movies. as the tom-boy George (georgina).its nice to see her with a change of clothes and looking more like a girl.

This said, the adults in the show also played an important part, and without them (Jez, Azazeal etc) the show wouldn't have worked.<br /><br />There's only one thing I don't get: Why did they cancel it?!",unsup
10454_0,"I'v watched the TV show Hex twice over and I still can not get enough of it. The show is excellent and would range from people my age which is 13 to people as old as 82. The show is an excellent combination of drama, comedy, romance and thriller. <br /><br />My personnel comment on the best character in the show would have to be Telma, because she doesn't care what any one things of her. She is a lesbian ghost and proud to be one.<br /><br />The show is sometimes compared to Buffy or Charmed but both of those shows don't have the specialness that Hex has. I now they all are about demons and chosen ones but I would gladly watch Hex over and over than watch a marathon of Charmed or Buffy.<br /><br />I think that the producers of the show should make another 5 to 6 series because at the end they just left you hanging with the characters, because almost anything could happen to them even though Malacky(sorry about my spelling) has taken over the school. I would still like to now if Ella finally gets her revenge and her and Leon finally get to have a normal relationship.",unsup

10459_0,"This movie so aptly depicts the typical local pub and its immediate environs like no other movie I can remember. No phony props or gussied-up stars need apply for this amazing blend of humor and pathos, centering on Tommy Basilio, a drifting, booze-loving, socially inept, confused 20-something, who is in the throes of a pre mid-life crisis. Steve Buscemi's genius lies his total absorption of the central character and his ability to extract much of the same from his fellow actors. One is totally immersed in the middle class consciousness of this typical Long Island suburb to the point that you actually feel you are watching this happen on a sidewalk in the town, rather than in a theater or on TV.<br /><br />You gotta love the character interaction between him and Chloe S. from the ice-cream truck to the ""Munchkin"" song. The cameo-ish performances of T. Lapaglia, Sam Jackson, etc. really augment the story line impeccably. Samuel Jackson has to crack you up when he says to Tommy's new-found drinking buddy: ""Your wife likes the city because she is a city girl, and you are too!"" Whoa..a city GIRL too??<br /><br />In short, great comedy, drama, romance, real life stuff...GREAT MOVIE!",unsup

If you watch the movie, with your eyes open, you can see that everybody is laughing through most of Paul's more volatile moments. If you are one of the people who is down on the movie because ""I wouldn't let him do that to..."", clearly they don't belong there. The truth is that Paul knows who can and can't take it and adjusts accordingly.<br /><br />The other criticism is generally... Does CJ really get anything from the school. I am one of CJ's biggest fans. Lets get that out of the way right now. But without the school, that allows him to play with equally talented people, he may be just like so many of the best guitar players that I have known.... the best guitar player in town in a local garage band with a revolving door membership that may get to play to the local drunks on Wednesday night for beer. Through his association with Paul, he has been to Zappanale, completed a west coast tour, been featured on MTV and played in more places than I can count.

10461_0,"I loved this movie from the first time I ever saw it. I had it at the end of a video tape I'd recorded (off IFC) after 'Monument Ave.', a Boston-mob film that had a similar ""bar tone"" to it, but was nothing like 'Trees Lounge.' 'Trees' takes place on Long Island and the vast array of crazy characters are a lot to choose from! There's a lot of humor in this film - and a lot of secrets & desires. The lounge is a bar that has a lot of losers who frequent it - the main one being Tommy (Buscemi)! There are the standard barflys who sit there all day drinking, and who must be on a fat social security paycheck to pay for it all! Anyway, we follow Tommy through his break-up with a gal he treated like crap and who has left him for one of his more-stable friends who owns a garage, going to family funerals and getting beaten up by a certain 'guido' in the 'hood. The only thing Tommy has, and the rest of his drinking buddies for that matter, is drinking his blues away. One of the cool people Tommy meets at the Trees is 'Mike', played by Mark Boone Junior - who gives a great performance as a guy who's wife is also threatening to leave him if he doesn't straighten up his act. So Mike & Tommy drink together and at one point, bring home 2 teenage girls to smoke some pot and dance to some records, in a bout of drunken bad judgement. When the wife returns, she asks Tommy if there were any girls there and Tommy, as a pro, covers for his new friend perfectly. There'a also a small part with Debbie Mazar, who Tommy almost gets to take home - until she passes out and her friends tell him to leave her alone! And Carol Kane is wonderful as the feisty bartender who keeps Tommy in line when he needs it. Also look for Kevin Corrigan as a coke-head loser, similar to the one he portrayed in Buffalo '66. By the end of the movie, you really start to feel sorry for Tommy. You wonder how much of it is based on Buscemi's life in New York, before he made it in the business. They say he actually drove an ice cream truck for awhile in NY, so that part must be true. All in all, Buscemi gets totally DICKED OVER in this film. But it is still a great film. And real. If you're a drinker, you might just see a bit of yourself in this film. 8 out of 10 stars",unsup
10462_0,"From the quirkiest of the quirky, Steve Buscemi premieres his first film with a nuclear blast. The cast, which most have gone on to really big films, all artfully create the character study which is what Tree's Lounge really happens to be. Each cast member should be awarded an Oscar for how real they portray this sad set of characters. Like a step into the daily wrongness of a typical craphole which can be anywhere in the USA, Buscemi's breakout performance as the alcoholic ice cream man captures a rawness of how a man can be degraded so swiftly in the morays and questionable social structures that permeate our culture. Brilliantly written, Buscemi makes the assumption of just how relationships are all based in fear and the fact of this fear is why the characters act out and react as they do throughout this film but as we all do in the real world as well. When looking for a slice of life that reminds us just how not to be, Tree's Lounge is the perfect example. This film is a triumph.",unsup

Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi.

He picks fights with his friends, loses jobs, and generally gets drunk and gets into trouble. There's a great scene where Buscemi takes a job as an ice-cream truck driver, he's completely the wrong person to do the job. Still, the movie doesn't really have many happy or fun moments, it's the portrayal of a guy who just doesn't care anymore and wants to spend his time hanging around a bar with a bunch of other regulars with no aim in life but the next drink.

It's about individuality, not conformity. It's about DIY, not this-foot-here-that-foot-there. I kept thinking about Dana Rohrabacher or some other such conservative jock-fascist chameleon, using their obvious rock/pop music knowledge to advance the most un-rockin' conformist agenda possible. Or Sonny Bono. Sure, there are those of you who think that musical rebellion knows no politics, but when you aren't at least a libertarian, when you're truly in the conservative jock headspace, your attitude and danger are as safe and salable as mayonnaise. Zappa would've known this asshole for what he is. A mean dick-head coach, whose only concern was that championship. Listening to this jackass put down '3-chord flannel' rock, I can only assume he meant Nirvana. A band whose converse he wouldn't be worthy to lick if they would have ever allowed anyone to lick their shoes.<br /><br />I still get my mailbox money from my music days--we had a lot of fun and I'll always be grateful for the recording and tours.

This demands the proper mix of compassion and dispassion, which for Buscemi, as for others similarly gifted, leads to an almost inseparable mix of comedy and pathos: up is down, down is up.<br /><br /> Buscemi plays himself, or what he probably would have been had he not found his talent in movie making, namely, a ""loser"" trapped in a downward spiral of unemployment, drugs, alcohol, and loneliness, familiar ingredients of endless movies, TV docudramas, talk shows, and news, all humbuggery and false preaching; so familiar, in fact, as to pose an American fixation, something we see so much of that we no longer see at all. <br /><br /> He's not afraid to let things get ugly, really ugly, down right squalid. An unemployed, unemployable car mechanic ends up by default driving an ice cream truck through the sun-drenched tree-lined streets of suburbia, a peculiarly American version of hell. Strange to say, the whole mess is uplifting and absurd; Buscemi loves his characters, warts and all; he warms us to them with a wealth of detail, emerging us in a whole crowd of people, complete with its own history and past, each member whole and completely formed, with hardly a trace of exaggeration or artifact, a false note or cliche. <br /><br />Because more is at stake--the ""American dream""--this is a better movie than Buscemi's i Living in Oblivion (1995), which was about the trials and tribulations of making an independent film on a shoe-string.

10477_0,"Steve Buscemi has long been one of the premiere character actors in the business; his resume reads like a veritable Who's Who of interesting, complex characters who run the gamut from psycho hit-man to regular guy, all of whom he has brought vividly to life in film after film. And whether or not a particular project is a hit or a flop, Buscemi is always good, and can always be counted upon to add that extra something to any given film, as he has in `Trees Lounge,' an affecting drama he not only stars in, but with which he makes his debut as a writer/director-- and an impressive debut it is.<br /><br />	Tommy Basilio (Buscemi) is an out-of-work mechanic who lives alone above a bar called Trees Lounge in Long Island, N.Y. He's more than a bit down on his luck; not only did he lose his job, but his pregnant girlfriend of eight years, Theresa (Elizabeth Bracco) recently dumped him for his former boss, Rob (Anthony LaPaglia). He wants to pick himself up and get his life back together, but he doesn't seem to know where to start, and the garages to which he's applied for work aren't exactly knocking his door down to hire him. So he gravitates to the Trees, where he can at least interact with others who seem to be in situations not entirely unlike his own, though at different stages and for different reasons. But they all have one thing in common-- they're people just trying to get through the day; they're trying to get through life. If they can only figure it all out.<br /><br />	With this film, Buscemi proves that he is more than just a talented actor, but rather a true artist in every sense of the word, with his chosen medium being film. He has an eye for detail which complements his insights into human nature and enables him to effectively translate his material to the screen. His characters are finely drawn and complex, and with each and every one he manages to successfully avoid the stereotypes to which a setting like this could easily lend itself (and no doubt would, in lesser hands). Even with the minor characters, he succinctly gives you enough of who they are that it allows you to see beneath the surface and know what makes them tick. And he does it imaginatively-- by filling a room with photographs or items that reflect who a certain person is, for example, or simply by training his camera on someone's face and allowing that extra beat that affords the viewer a telling glimpse of what's hiding behind a character's eyes. Buscemi has an innate sense of knowing how to convey what he's trying to say, and he does it in a million small and different ways that are subtle and incisive. Simply put, he knows what works-- including how to get what he wants out of his actors-- and he presents it all with a pace and timing that are right on the mark.<br /><br />	In Tommy, Buscemi creates a character to whom many will be able to relate and identify on any number of different levels. To say that Tommy is a `loser' would be too much of a simplification, because the character is too complex for that tag alone to be accurate. Tommy is blue-collar, down on his luck, and like so many people in real life, just can't seem to put it all together, can't figure out how `life' is supposed to work. And that's what Buscemi conveys so subtly and so well, and it's the key to the success of this character-- it's what makes Tommy believable and real. Obviously, Buscemi knew exactly what he wanted when he wrote this character, and he puts it across with a brilliant, memorable performance which also demonstrates his ability to star in and carry a movie on his own. Certainly, he has a wonderful supporting cast that gives him plenty of help, but few character actors have ever been able to step into a lead role with such facility and achieve the level of success Buscemi has here. And it's work that deserves to be acknowledged.<br /><br />	There are a number of notable supporting performances in this film, as well, beginning with Mark Boone Junior, who as Mike captures the essence of a guy who is successful, but a loser nonetheless; LaPaglia, who gives a solid performance as Rob; Bracco, with a performance that is introspectively revealing; Debi Mazar, who with very little screen time leaves an indelible impression (and her eyes are absolutely mesmerizing); Kevin Corrigan (another of the finest character actors around), as Matthew; and especially Chloe Sevigny, as Debbie, Theresa's mature-beyond-her-years, seventeen-year-old niece. <br /><br />	Rounding out the ensemble cast are Carol Kane (Connie), Bronson Dudley (Bill), Michael Buscemi (Steve's real life brother, playing Tommy's brother, Raymond), Suzanne Shepherd (Jackie), Rockets Redglare (Stan), Seymour Cassel (Uncle Al), Annette Arnold (Sandy), Michael Imperioli (George), Mimi Rogers (Patty), Daniel Baldwin (Jerry) and Charles Newmark (Puck). An involving story presented with a rich assortment of memorable, convincing characters, `Trees Lounge' is a drama about life-- about the things going on in your own neighborhood, or downtown or two streets over, no matter where you are in the world. Wherever people are, there are situations like the ones depicted in this film, problems that have to be solved and life that has to be lived. And that's what makes this film so good; it gives the audience a chance to connect with, or at least examine, things that anyone anywhere will be able to recognize. It may have taken a collaborative effort to make this one what it is, but in the end, it's Buscemi's film from start to finish, and a satisfying little gem of a movie it is. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10.",unsup

Just sit back - preferably with a lager and allow Tree's Lounge to charm your trousers off.<br /><br />Wonderfully subdued comedy showing that Buscemi Is not only a cult anti hero on screen but that he has much promise as a director. The characters stand out as they can be related to - everyone will recognise the Bill type regular permanently attached to the counter. Mark Boone's wife also as a seriously difficult woman who hasn't a clue what she really wants, stereotypically so. Tommy yes, Is a manchild aimlessly squandering his life away, for sure It Isn't a good role model to aspire to approaching middle age but hey that's his perogative.<br /><br />This Is Steve's film and he's got charisma by the barrow full to make Tree's Lounge a real treat. That trick with the glasses will work once - provided your not too hammered practising. But It's Uncle Al who gets the best lines - ""he loves your mothers"", his excuse for his lecherous behaviour on the couch will bail a lot of people out of a lot of trouble.<br /><br />This film Is very hard to track down, 90% of video shops I went to hadn't even heard of It and It's been on terrestrial Tele twice - once a week late- the reward Is well worth the effort.",unsup

Totally engrossing, especially to a *cough* former *cough* barfly like myself. Beautifully understated, funny, very sad, nicely paced and Buscemi very wisely NOT trying to dominate every scene, although he certainly dominates the movie.<br /><br />Movie appears on first sight plot less but actually it isn't at all: Buscemi's search for a second chance to escape from the morass of his own making is riveting. Everyone involved seems to have had a good time and the beautifully relaxed performances are the reward. Only the two knucklehead goombahs fall below the otherwise uniformly excellent level.<br /><br />A real treat, and thoroughly watchable-again able. My DVD was in TV format, which sucked, but otherwise the low budget doesn't really intrude.<br /><br />Nearest movie to it I can think of offhand is KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE.

1047_0,"First off, I'm a huge fan of documentaries. A lot of times I really enjoy them but am slow to recommend them to friends as broad appeal is sometimes limited. (American Movie being a huge exception). Rock School is just great, both as entertainment and certainly succeeds as a documentary. I would like to address the heavy handedness that others reviewing this film seem to take at the Zappa-heavy content or the tearing apart of Paul Green, the namesake of the Paul Green School of Rock. It is true that there is a lot of Zappa, a lot of fiery temper, and some harshness from the man himself. I guess I would ask those who attack the film with low ratings (because of the man) if they have ever had crowds bow down in front of them in a foreign country after performing so well? This film succeeds in its ability to deftly pull you into the reality of the school. You meet the kids, the instructor, and some parents and are constantly and linearly drawn to what feels like a very organic conclusion. I was very impressed at the rate at which you identify with the kids and the parents, and the ability of the director to edit in such a way to provide just the right amount of emphasis. Paul Green is completely right in his teaching technique. Paul Green is completely wrong in his teaching technique. Doesn't matter. Rock School is extremely entertaining and very interesting and compelling because of one thing Paul says early in the film... ""It's easy to be a novelty act, a bunch of kids playing rock, but the goal is to do it very well..."" The kids can indeed play. I especially enjoy the confession that ""The Guitar teacher and the Guitar Player inside me are always at odds, as a teacher I want to make them better, but the player doesn't like that at all"". The best part of the documentary is the way there is the prodigy juxtaposed with the sad emo kid, who was my favorite character... each has his own relationship to the instructor and each has a different outlook on life, on music, and on the school. I especially enjoyed Will O' Conner's (sad emo kid) candor in addressing a newspaper article in which he was misquoted. I felt that Mr. Green was indeed hamming it up in parts, but it didn't hurt the documentary at all. In fact, the character and role he has created for himself is one I find fascinating. I think and genuinely believe he cares about those kids. And wants them to succeed. And refuses to grow up. And gets results. The film itself is 1.78:1 and looks great, sounds great. Those of you used to docs looking and sounding sub-par despite being great (I'm looking at you, Paper Clips) and having genuinely fascinating moments but being very unevenly paced (Spellbound) will find this fresh and fun. The performance footage shown is just enough. Not so much you feel it's there to artificially pad the run time, and not so short you can't get a feel for their talent. The interviews are well placed, well directed, and very well edited. There are a lot of moments in the movie where you'll wish it were longer... but not so much you feel cheated. A good documentary is one, in my opinion, has got to show equal parts of an obvious passion for the subject material and those the camera capture as well as the courage to be honest. In today's land of multi-movie propaganda lectures, this is a great relief from the Greenwalds and the Moores... they could learn a lot from the masterful pacing and invisibility of Don Argott. You forget this is a documentary entirely... there is no agenda. Andrew Jarecki's BRILLIANT Capturing the Friedman's is one of the slight few other examples I can think of that play that card so well. Here it's raised to an art form. The exception being the last minute or two of the film that really tie it together in a very nice way. Kudos all around, I'll be keeping an eye out for more from Mr. Argott.",unsup
10480_0,"Excellent film dealing with a group of unhappy people who drown their sorrows in booze, powder, and sex. The chief sorrowmeister, Tommy, was a pathetic loser who spent inordinate amounts of time swilling beer and shots in a shabby bar which boasted a temperamental barkeep, a postage stamp sized men's room, and one table. When not turning his liver into plywood Tommy halfheartedly attempts to find work as a mechanic but winds up driving his uncle's ice cream wagon and getting in over his head with a troubled teen on the verge of bolting from daddy's violent household. A sad picture for sure, but I couldn't help laughing out loud at some of these characters' antics. A very fine movie depicting a realistic looking slice of the ugly side of our human existence.",unsup
10481_0,"If John Cassavetes was alive, he'd have a copy of Trees Lounge in his video library. This is a story that is hard to tell, let alone find an audience. Although many can relate with the cast of lost souls hanging out at a bar most of the day, many will not admit to being somewhat connected to any of the characters. Filmed for less that 2 million, this independent, low budget, and somewhat of a masterpiece is brilliant as well as entertaining. Much of the cast has gone on to do other known films. Carol Kane, Mark Boone Junior Steve Buscemi, Bronson Dudley, Anthony LaPaglia and Steve's brother Michael Buscemi star in this Minnie and Moskowitz type story. Seymour Cassell and Mimi Rogers add their touch of magic to this story as well. A deep story with deep characters, this is a movie worth watching.",unsup

I wanted this movie to keep going, I wanted to see what else would happen to the characters. While the film doesn't entirely paint the happy bar room existence that Barfly did it does make a pretty accurate portrail of good portion of the drinkers culture. Every actor in this movie hits just the right note especially Chloe Sevigny, who has never looked more fetching. One of those silly Baldwins even turns in a fine performance. Steve Buscemi wrote and directed this movie and I shall be rather intrested in any subsequent work he does in either field.<br /><br />10 out of 10.",unsup

Buscemi'second self directed/penned feature is slower paced than some might expect. This in no way detracts from the overall brilliance and charm that trees lounge conveys. Tommy's character, while on the surface, demands both pity and sympathy. It's in his anti-heroic attributes ie. selfishness and callousness, that make the film so human and believable. American releases as passionate and warm as Trees Lounge do not come around as often anymore, with only The Station Agent coming close. So enjoy.",unsup
10484_0,"Whenever one thinks of Steve Buscemi the actor, one probably thinks of the line about his character in FARGO, where a girl says, ""Well, he was funny looking...more than most people, even."" That has more or less summed up the parts Buscemi has played throughout the years, way back to the mini-series of LONESOME DOVE. But he's got more range than that, as he showed in LIVING IN OBLIVION(1995), and this movie, which he also wrote and directed. The nice surprise is he also has the makings of a fine writer and director. There's no real plot here, which undoubtedly will throw some people(and has, if some of the comments are any indication), just observing a certain type of people(working-class and barflies) and how they live their lives. While it may drag at times, there's enough truth and detail to keep you interested. Buscemi also directs actors well; this is the film which convinced me Chloe Sevigny was for real. I understand Buscemi is making another film; I look forward to it.",unsup
10485_0,"So what? Maybe we should come to the conclusion that he/she who teases evil is destined to be hit by it. But I don't like this film. I didn't like its joking evolution and disapprove the final, never-ending, gore scene where the young hypnotized girl's sufferance, a prologue to everybody else's, is depicted in a hard-hitting monologue. It reminded me of a similar scene seen in the contorted, convolved ""Baby of Macon"" (the film that signed the end of my love for Greenaway) and I hated it, notwithstanding the evident difference, that being a scene of external violence while this is more a self-inflicted violence scene. The only appreciable side of the film is the grainy black and white used: too few, ain't it?

10488_0,"Lars Von Trier seems to be able to make just two kind of movie: awful ones and excellent ones. Epidemic has been scheduled in order to obtain money for another movie - Lars intended to ask money for two different movies and to use almost all of the money to realize the first one (Europe), leaving few dollars to realize the second one (Epidemic). Epidemic has no script, no actors and almost no director. It's just a funny joke. It can be amusing if you are really involved with Lars, Niels, and his wife, otherwise it makes no sense. I rate one star just because it is not possible to write ""rating does not apply"". If you are interested in Lars Von Trier visual and poetic art, try to consider before the more recent (and in some way, more ""accessible"") works like ""Breaking the Waves"", ""Dancer in the Dark"", and ""Dogville"". ""Europa"" can be the following step and, if you like it, maybe ""Idioterne"" and ""Forbrydelsens element"" can be the following one. The TV series ""Riget"" I and II are really enjoyable and are an all-audience product - Lars said it made them just for money. Obviously, they're not a mixture of ""E.R."" and ""Twin Peaks"", as someone said. The style of ""Epidemic"" is very similar to that of ""Riget"", but the plot is meaningless. From a certain point of view, ""Epidemic"" is like an home made movie: it can be funny according to the ones who made it, and maybe it can be appreciated by their friends, but shouldn't be programmed on the big screen (...unless someone has given you some money to make it...)",unsup
10489_0,"* SPOILER WARNING * Director Lars Von Trier, who stars as himself in this mock documentary meta-horror black comedy drama (!), comments early on that ""a film should be a pebble in your shoe"". With this, he may have accomplished just that. It´s an annoying mess of a movie, which tries to make sense in the last scene, but by then you have been subjected to tons of extraneous footage, bad dubbing, clues and a pretentious movie-within-a-movie, also called Epidemic. Von Trier and cowriter Niels Vørsel tries to finish their script and convince film institute executive Claes Kastholm to finance their movie about a mysterious plague spreading through Europe, but the epidemic seems to have started in real life as well. Or something. The chilling giallo-inspired climactic hypnosis sequence (with real life hypnotist Svend Ali Hamann) is effective, but Von Trier´s ad hoc filmmaking style will test the viewer´s patience. He does, however, make an interesting visit to the hospital, as a sort of premonition to his later hits ""The Kingdom 1 + 2"". Udo Kier appears briefly as himself. A box office disaster; well two, actually, if you count the vastly ignored re-release in 1997. *½<br /><br />",unsup
1048_0,"The hard part about writing this review is separating my feelings about this man (Paul Green), his school (The School of Rock in Philadelphia), and the documentary about both (Rock School). Paul is an arrogant, selfish, and demeaning man, but his school produces some incredible talent, and the movie that director Don Argott made is clever, witty, and downright funny.<br /><br />Paul Green's ""School of Rock"" has 120 students, ages 9 through 17, who learn to play everything from Black Sabbath to Frank Zappa, and most importantly, Paul gets his students on stage and teaches them how to perform like a rock star. But he's horrible. He's like Simon Cowell in that really mean and insulting kind of way. But perhaps that kind of cruelty pushes them to work even harder and practice more to perfect their craft. He does everything that any other teacher today would instantly get sued for  he curses at them, yells at them, makes them cry, hits them, tells them that they ""suck,"" and asks them if they love Satan (he does that to pump them up for the Black Sabbath concert they're about to put on).<br /><br />It's endlessly amusing to watch 9 year-olds wear all black, smear eyeliner all over their eyes, draw crosses on their foreheads, and write ""OZZY"" on their knuckles. And to see their mom doing all that for them is even funnier! The coolest moment of Rock School, however, is when the very top students are flown to Germany to play at ""Zappanele"", the largest Frank Zappa Festival in the world, and they perform with an original member of Zappa's band. Then, to have the original band member, plus the entire Zappanele audience, blow before them in praise (literally bowing!) was out of this world! Not every music student gets an experience like that.<br /><br />Argot does a great job at showing us all sides of Paul Green's personality. I hate him in one scene and love what he does for these kids in the next. If Rock School does anything, it will make you want to get off your butt and start practicingwhat ever it is that you love. You'll want to pick up an instrument, or start painting, or get back to studying. This movie makes you want to be the best at something, and it makes you want to work for it.",unsup

It's done in a very ambitious way, incredibly sophisticated and elegant when we know the budget who was assigned to the movie.<br /><br />A lot of scenes are incredible, specially the one who shows the contamination of the priest, adding a reflection on the condition of the black man. Obviously the last scene is one of the most incredible things I've seen on a screen, but we can doubt the mental health of Von Trier and his crew. However maybe it's the reason he's so good...<br /><br />I didn't like a few things. I think there is too much time about the creation of the movie, a few ridiculous and unappropriated moments as the story of the American letters of Niels",unsup
10491_0,"Lars von Trier is a genius when he actually makes a film, as he did with Element of Crime and Europa, two visually stunning films that I absolutely love. But here, von Trier does not so much tell a story as tell a story about people writing a story and then give us all-too-brief segments of that story. If von Trier had just filmed the story about the doctor who tries to cure a plague but instead ends up spreading it, we would have had another masterpiece. Indeed, the segments that tell this story are wonderful. But to get to these gems, which make up perhaps 5 percent of the movie, we have to wade through intolerable stretches of 16mm excrement. Lars and his friend think up this idea, visit this place, talk to Udo Kier, frustrate and infuriate the viewer with impossibly boring stretches of cinema verité. The experience was painful. In fact, I'll deduct some credit for pain and suffering.",unsup
10492_0,"The plot: a director and a screenwriter lose the screenplay they've been working on due to hard disk corruption and start working on another project called ""Epidemic"". The film follows their misadventures but in the meantime a real epidemic is starting to develop around them, but goes by unnoticed. Oh and also fragments of the film-in-a-film ""Epidemic"" are shown in-between. Oh and Lars Von Trier (the director) and Niels Vorsel (the screenwriter) are the protagonists playing, ahem, the director and the screenwriter. Lovely.<br /><br />And if by reading this the first thought that came to your mind is ""black comedy"", then go to the top of the class cause you're absolutely right. The best thing about this film is how it ridicules film-making and yet somehow is a good example of artistic pompousness. But then again we know that Von Trier is a cynical little bugger. Udo Kier's cameo recalling WW2 is brilliant. Be warned though, definitely an acquired taste.",unsup
10493_0,"Epidemic appears to be all stylistic self-indulgence. It is filmed in black and white, with often purposely redundant subtitles. Each shot is very very long. Some are stoic, some are suddenly goofy, some are disturbing, mostly stoic. When there is dialogue, it is intellectually stimulating, but borderline irrelevant.<br /><br />Mainly, it is that director Lars Von Trier and his screenplay collaborator Niels Vorsel play themselves, coming up with a last-minute script for a producer. This strand takes disproportionate turns with scenes from their script, in which Von Trier plays a radical doctor attempting to cure a modern-day epidemic. In an warped turn, the doctor finds that he himself has been spreading it. For so long, one is left without a clue as to why there is such a coincidence between the screenplay and the outside world, or any progressions of the different narrative strands' signifying signs. But it infects you. It burns you.<br /><br />Whether or not the film is narcissistic, it is not form over function. Essentially, it is a basic exercise in what metaphysically affects the viewer. Consider the scene of the darker, quieter of the screenwriters in the subway, knowing predeterminately that the other one is going to die. Or when he looks in a mirror, turns to us, the camera, then the mirror again. Everything one expects would create a cohesive, sense-making narrative film is inverted and indeed develops an immediately conscious connection between itself and the audience.<br /><br />That is not to say it eschews any fundamental aspect of quality. Udo Kier delivers one of the most amazing, fantastic performances I have ever seen. Really, many of the performances, whoever these actors, or characters, are, shock and deeply move us. Some scenes are entirely made up of uproarious laughter or breakdowns of screaming, in spite of the unapologetic stoicism and quiet permeating the film.<br /><br />This hypnotic abstraction is truly very atmospheric and creepy. It is a transcendental, almost physiologically affecting virus that infests you for days upon being subjected to it. It is something that has to be seen and can hardly be explained. And that makes it a true work of art.",unsup
10494_0,"EPIDEMIC (Lars von Trier - Demark 1987).<br /><br />This second feature by Lars von Trier reveals many of the director's obsessions with cinema. Here the self-imposed limitations on film-making in many ways foreshadow his obstructions upon Jorgen Leth in THE FIVE OBSTRUCTIONS (2003).<br /><br />Or is this again von Trier's little joke on all of us? This is essentially a film about his own obsessions, or a grand parody on horror, as some suggested. Von, Trier, frustrated by the delay of his never realized project, ""The Grand Mal"", about two gangster families in divided Berlin, made a bet with film consultant Claes Kastholm of the Danish Film Institute, claiming that he could make a feature film for one million Danish kroner. Resulting partly in an amateur movie about a film director and a scriptwriter who must write a new manuscript in five days, interspersed with scenes from the film they are working on - about a young idealistic doctor in the late 20th century, who tries to fight an epidemic, but only manages to spread it further. The film culminates with the outbreak of a deadly plague, not in the past but in the present. Throughout the film, Von Trier shows his fascination with Germany, for example, during a ride through the ""Ruhrgebiet"", the industrial core of Europe, or the world, at least during the '80s.<br /><br />I watched this with interest, but despite the sometimes fascinating introspective of Von Trier the filmmaker, or the filmmaker in general, this hardly is a great film, but he manages to make something unique with this strange mixture of Dogma-style improvisation and carefully enscenated scenes as the one with the doctors in the basement of the University Libarary.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 8/10",unsup

From Mr. Noodle to Dorothy the whole thing is all about ""can-do"" preschoolers.<br /><br />So, why, in this TERRIBLE movie would they create this very unnatural dependency that Elmo has on his blanket? Elmo no longer is the encouraging fun loving muppet . .but he is a panicked, insecure, selfish muppet. The opening 5 minutes are joyless, despite all the Sesame Street favorites being put in every frame in each shot. The people are particularly bad.

We see many qualities children posses that we as adults lack at times, determination, love for our enemies and working for what we want. <br /><br />I think Mandy Patinkin makes just the right kind of villain for a children's program, with just the right amount of meanness and humor to not make it too scary.

10509_0,"Everyone loves that furry, lovable red monster, Elmo. Ever since ""Follow That Bird"", ""Elmo in Grouchland"" is a way more colorful version for kids, and there's more fun to it. Elmo has this blanket that he loves very much, and after a tug-of-war with Zoe, Oscar the Grouch tosses the blanket after he blows his nose with it. Where does it goes, in Grouchland. On Sesame Street, there was a place called GrouchyTown. In this movie, Grouchland is being run by a really rude man named Huxley(Mandy Patankin). He the worst person to be around. When Elmo goes to Grouchland to retrieve his blanket, he meets some unusual characters there. He meets a girl grouch who his nothing like the others. Very kind, very neat, and very cooperative. Mostly grouches hate cooperation, even Oscar can bend the rules of his kind. When he was a resident there, he knew what it's like. So he got the grouches there to change their attitude's, and their ways a bit. Anthor character in the movie is the Queen of Trash(Vanessa L. Williams). I liked the part where Elmo had to do 100 Raspberries. She was also a friendly person there. This movie deals with sharing, while ""Follow that Bird"" deals with diversity. This movie is very good for kids, as well, and other generations to come. Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",unsup

But let's face it, he was playing to the camera and 6-9 months worth of interactions were condensed down to the most entertaining cursing sessions. You could see the counter balance to the rants, in the end sequences there was much affection expressed all around.<br /><br />But, lets focus on the film here; it is funny, moving and shows what kids can do when expectations are high.

10513_0,"This is a movie which manages to portray the consequences of modern day war on people's lives with a degree of realism that I have yet to see in most other films of the genre - one possible exception being Kubrick's Apocalypse Now.<br /><br />The most tangible aspect of this realism is found in the fact that no character in the movie can claim to be a 'hero'. The concept of a 'war hero' I consider to be a dangerous pitfall, which many movies of the genre are only too happy to fall into. Probably because it makes the horrors of war slightly more meaningful - and thus bearable - if they are construed as 'obstacles', which the 'hero' must overcome in order to achieve his ultimate aim.<br /><br />In 'Savior', there are only victims.<br /><br />The movie explains this by describing war as a state of society where the ones most likely to survive are those who have let go of all values. Notice how neither Guy nor Vera - the main characters - ever fully manage to reach this state of total cynicism even though they both try. This is why a quest to regain their humanity is sure to end up victimising both of them.<br /><br />In summary, the main achievement of 'Savior' is in making tangible the viewpoint of Thomas Hobbes, who said that war must generally be avoided, because in war, human life is 'brutish, nasty and short'.<br /><br />Natasa Ninkovic deserves praise for her frighteningly believable performance as Vera.",unsup

A quick skim through IMDb and a couple of them stand out for me, films I've thoroughly enjoyed and would happily see again; ""The Right Stuff"" and ""Enemy Mine"".

10518_0,"I am astounded by those who see this mainly as some sort of pro or con statement on the Balkan wars. It seems clearly about loss of a man's soul to sorrow and his road back to redemption. The violence, although frighteningly real, exists in the film as both the problem and solution for the main character. Indiscriminate hatred and violent atrocities against all humanity provide the locomotion, propelling this gripping drama to a bitter-sweet ending. There is alway a bias from those who have actually lived the history of these times and they feel it is incumbent on them to point out the factual errors--and perhaps they should. I know a few people from New Orleans who hated the exaggerations and misinformation in the movie ""The Big Easy"". I am not from New Orleans and enjoyed the film. Movies are not documentaries unless they state they are documentaries--and even then you can never be sure of unbiased facts (Michael Moore). ""Savior"" may have used the Balkan violence as an environment to place his story about ""Guy"". It could have been Korea, Germany, Iraq and been just as effective. The big picture was certainly not about Croasian or Serbian morality. It was about one very troubled man's trek to find peace within himself.",unsup
10519_0,"I've watched this film several times, the first time being in the late 90's, and then again just recently. It's truly an outstanding film that depicts the horrors faced by civilians in all wars, and how conflict and human suffering brings out both the best and worst in us.<br /><br />My wife is a Croatian citizen, and her family fled the country in the early 90's when the region first began to break apart, just hours away from being swept up into the war themselves. She was a teenager at the time, and she once told me that no one believed that the war would actually escalate so far, until before they realized it, a battle was being fought in the neighboring town a few miles away. Her parents made a wise decision to drop everything, grab the kids, and head for the border... Someone told them that just hours after they left, the roads out were blocked, and men were being conscripted into the army to fight. Fight for what? Her mother is a catholic Croatian and her father is an orthodox Serbian. Now all of a sudden, they are supposed to be enemies? A tale played out over and over in human history, yet we still have not learned our lesson.<br /><br />I also had the chance to visit the region, specifically Croatia, in 1999. Most of the parts that I visited were still in shambles, with almost every structure in ruins. Go outside and take a good look at the neighborhood that you live in. Now imagine 99% of the homes either completely leveled, or so damaged that they are uninhabitable. Anyone who thinks that war is glamorous, like Hollywood almost always portrays it, should visit a war torn country sometime. WHAT A WASTE!!! That's the Croatia that I saw in the 90's.<br /><br />Last month, I went back for my second visit, 7 years later. Wow, what a difference. The people of Croatia, along with the United Nations, have been busy rebuilding. Croatia is truly a beautiful country. The coast is extremely beautiful, and the National parks Plitvitce and Krka are beyond words. I see hope returning to the area....",unsup

I rehearsed for weeks and won!...After it was over I realized that EVERYONE had won something.....all 50 kids!<br /><br />I was placated into thinking that was how life worked, then wham, the reality of musical life hit me when I went on the road in the real world.<br /><br />Let's face it, people as a rule (and young people in particular) are basic under-achievers. Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of ""frustration love"" to make it all click. <br /><br />Music itself is a passion, not a method, and rock music even more so than most.<br /><br />As a parent myself I would suggest this movie to anyone who has a musically inclined child not matter what genre' they wish to pursue.<br /><br />Competition is within ones self, not against everyone else.

Some parts will make you shudder in horror, and others will bring you to tears. This tale of the Bosnian civil war brings the whole, strange (for Americans), savage and sordid truths about ""ethnic cleansing"" straight into your living room via the VCR.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid delivers the role of a lifetime as a former U.S. government agent driven mad by grief to attack innocent Muslim worshippers at a mosque, which leads to a 6-year stint in the French Foreign Legion. Once free of his commitment to the Legion, he becomes a mercenary in Bosnia, where he continues his vengeance campaign against Muslims.<br /><br />But as Quaid finds out, his allies can be scummier than his foes; this is the setup of ""Savior,"" wherein Quaid redeems his humanity to save a helpless baby, yet another victim of the nameless war.<br /><br />One thing that Roger Ebert doesn't mention: The guys with the hammers are Croats, not Serbs or Bosniaks (Muslims).

10522_0,"I can't add a lot to the other reviews, but I too thought it was an excellent movie. I missed the beginning (on a television movie channel), so I had no idea who was murdering who, except that the atrocities were happening in the former Yugoslavia. But that actually strengthened the message, that the primary victims of the war were civilians, not the armed combatants, who were often much more murderers of civilians than soldiers. I also didn't know the reason for Dennis Quaid's alienation, just that he was angry and miserable. My initial impression was that he was the baby's savior (and had tried to be Natasa Ninkovic's savior also). But other comments here point out that the baby was his savior as well -- from his own misery and alienation. He and the baby saved each other<br /><br />The acting and directing were first-rate. The scenic photography was excellent too, but sometimes the tight budget showed, particularly in the sound quality. Still, the technical quality was generally quite good. The mix of English, subtitled local languages, and untranslated local languages was quite effective -- subtitles were used where they helped tell the story, but left out where the American's non-comprehension was the main point.<br /><br />In spite of the mildly optimistic ending (which I found appropriate), it was a very gloomy movie. But it's such a good movie that you should see it, when you're in the mood for a very sad story.",unsup
10523_0,"Once in a while one is just moved. Moved into the picture, as though right alongside the characters, the action, the sound and the fury (of the war in Bosnia.) The dark odyssey of the soldier (Dennis Quaid) begins in tragedy--the death of his wife and son, whom he has been neglecting because of his military duties) in an alleged Muslim extremist cafe bombing--and leads him on a rocky, suspenseful chase to redemption. On the way he works as an assassin/sniper for the Foreign Legion, and as a mercenary-sniper for the Serbs. He commits cold blooded murder regularly, hard-heartedly, until he shoots a peasant teenage boy. This is his turning point. His conscience seems to reinvent itself. He intervenes in the savage beating of a pregnant woman, delivers her child, and thus begins the redelivery of himself into renewed morality and humanity. An important part of the journey of the baby girl, the mother, and the wounded ""savior"" is the effective and affecting portrayals of these characters by Quaid and the (I think Serbian actress) young woman. She has been cast out by her family and is very reluctant to accept the child or Quaid. The story moves along a perilous road with many painfully tense--and unpredictable event (not a cliche in the picture, unless one thinks beautiful babies and weeping rescuers is maudlin--moments and tragic scenes. I don't think this film is well know in the states; what a pity. I don't think Quaid (and many fine European actors) garned awards and recognition for this film, I do think Mr. Quaid created one of the finest characters/performances I have seen in the movies. Of course it also turns out that this picture has revived (and unfortunate) significance today--since 9/11. Recommended at an 8 level from. . . jaime",unsup

I'm sure that's true, but don't make me sit through a film about 'evil Jews' during WW2. I ain't buying it. Why didn't this film give us a glimpse of a Serb run death camp, where thousands of Bosnian civilians were tortured and killed? We saw it on the TV news.

There is not one likable character except for the pregnant woman/mother. **possible spoilers** Dennis Quaid plays an unbelievable protagonist who goes to a mosque and shoots a bunch of people who are praying to God because he lost his family?!! Being furious and being crazed is understandable but they depict everyone who is Muslim as evil which is pretty ridiculous. Why would they have any weapons in a mosque? Moreover, it does not make any sense to see a five year old kid throw a grenade at the soldiers with a pretty smile on his face. The whole movie shows this monster of a guy(Dennis Quaid) who faces all these people who are only as evil as him and that transforms him into a better man? I did not buy it at all. Collateral Damage is a much better movie dealing with a similar subject.

Some people have claimed this is a racist film. I do not see it that way. This film shows everyone in a bad light. There are no heroes here. It shows how hate and prejudice can pose as patriotism.This is one of Dennis Quaid's best performances.

Yugoslavia was of no use anymore... communism was down in Eastern Europe, there was no need for an western-oriented outpost behind the Iron Curtain... so NATO decided it must be somewhat erased, diminished... I am ashamed to admit that at a certain point during this war, the leaders of my country sold out to NATO like prostitutes and allowed Alliance planes to cross Romanian territory en-route to the conflict zone...

Stony-faced Dennis Quaid is excellent as ever as the emotionally-shut-off mercenary tiring of the pointless and unresolvable fighting in Bosnia, slowly allowing himself to feel again some years after the horrific death of his family when a woman and child inveigle themselves into his life. Some of the scenes in here are beyond horrific, particularly near the end where a massacre of civilians is made to seem quite dull and everyday to the killers. The pointlessness of such tribal warfare is emphasised by the shadowy depiction of the combatants, the almost total absence of 'good guys' and 'baddies' - I for one could rarely tell which side the soldiers on screen were supposed to represent.

Let`s see Joshua Rose wife and child are murdered by Islamic terrorists so he shoots up a mosque . Can any tell me when this incident happened ? because I don`t recall any news reports about it . And why did Peter join the legion ? Surely he acted in self defence ? It also seems strange that the Croat defence council ( HVO ) decided to drive their Serb and Muslim victims right beside Joshua`s hiding place to be massacared .<br /><br />Despite this criticism SAVIOR is a good film . I remember disliking it first time I saw it because I`d written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that there`s no good guys in the Bosnian conflict . Jealousy aside ( I had my heart on SOLITUDE winning the best original screenplay Oscar ) I do admire SAVIOR for being an intelligent , sad and haunting film . Despite having Oliver Stone as producer and an American star this is a totally European film in both feel and execution "" I had a son . He`s dead . He had a son . He`s dead too . Both died fighting - For what ? "" a Croat tells Joshua . What indeed<br /><br />I wouldn`t say this is the best Bosnian conflict movie ( That accolade goes to PRETTY VILLAGE PRETTY FLAME ) but it`s probably the most accesible to a western audience .

The hero finds himself surrounded by death and destruction. He chose his life as a soldier in the Foreign legion as an act of revenge to purge his anger from losing his family. Soon, war and anger overcomes and all that is left is the ""Savior"". Who is the savior? I'll leave that up to you the viewer to discover for yourself. Excellent film overall. This is my favorite performance by Dennis Quaid.",unsup
10537_0,"I noticed this had been produced by Oliver Stone when I saw it for sale, thus my reasoning for snapping it up. Usually what Stone touches turns to gold and this is no exception<br /><br />This film will move you to tears; mark my words. I wasn't ready for it, or at least wasn't expecting it. Realism is the key to its power.<br /><br />While some viewers may focus on which ethnic groups are committing what crimes, for the wider audience I think it has a commentary on the human race in general and what it is capable of. <br /><br />Quaid performs his part from top to bottom, which drains the viewer of emotion, making one actually process information that has previously just been news broadcast.<br /><br />A good mix of local and international filmaking skills also present what I would consider an accurate picture of the racial and religious groups depicted in the movie. I'm sure insiders will disagree, but from my time spent in the region, there was not a scene or individual character where I was skeptical of objectivity - from the bus driver to father.<br /><br />There is so much to be said about Savior, and it is a must see for any international audience. It may unearth a conflict of opinions among serbs, croats and bosnians, but perhaps they would be reading too much into it...",unsup
10538_0,"Great movie and easily Dennis Quaid's best work. Very tough to watch at times but in the end extremely rewarding and cathartic.<br /><br />Its so appreciated that some artists in the world have something to say and do a timely, thoughtful movie to tell the world what they are missing or ignoring. You can either see what they have to say, or see the next assembly line CGI garbage. I suggest that any mature moviegoer give this a look. <br /><br />There is some unexpected humor, a lot of horror and carnage and heartache, and I do suggest you keep the tissues close by for a some incredibly emotional scenes. <br /><br />There is not a whole lot of dialogue which is also much appreciated. Most of the time actors are better when they have nothing to say but alot to express. The actors in this movie are all very natural and real. Not the least of which was the baby! One of the best performances by a new born I've ever seen..this child is beautiful. <br /><br />Thanks to Dennis Quaid who probably made the equivalent of cab fare for this one..you did a great job in an invaluable movie.",unsup
10539_0,"I know that many people consider this movie 'Politically incorrect'. Probably it is in some way. I'm not from the Balkans, but I live very near and I remember very well that war in front of my door and I was against the Serbs. This movie was made by a Serb director and show his point of view. Anyway I think that in this movie you can see what was that war for civilian people, any side they were. I found it a true document about the war, and, in the end, I was not disturbed by the fact that it was a movie from a Serb director. I think that this demonstrates that it's a good movie. After watching this movie, you don't hate the Serbs, the Croatians or the Bosnians, you hate the war for the consequences on civilian people.",unsup

10540_0,"Prince of Persia - The Two Thrones was one of the most anticipated games of 2005, and one of the most disappointing for me. A good overall game that brings very little freshness to the scene.<br /><br />UbiSoft should definitely be praised for the upgrades this game has brought compared to the previous titles. Graphically, the game looks and plays much smoother, but there are no real new technical enhancements to speak of.<br /><br />The music also returns to a much more Persian feel, compared to Warrior Within. A feature that 99% of the fans might consider an improvement... but I'm part of the 1%. As an overall aesthetic choice, it does bring more immersiveness to the environment, but since 50% of the action takes place while you chop off the heads off random creatures, the metal beat of WW just felt more adequate (imo).<br /><br />The Dark Prince also brings about a new dynamic to the world, as the often humorous verbal encounters between the Prince and his corrupted self caused me to stop playing for a minute or two, just to better enjoy their bickering. Rick Miller is to be commended for brining the Prince's dark persona to life.<br /><br />What I didn't really enjoy about the game on the other hand... would be a bit more controversial. Yuri Lowenthal for example. Don't get me wrong, his voice acting is top-notch, what really disappointed me is that I was expecting to see a much more mature Prince in this third and final installment. Instead, I was treated with a 'younger' Prince of both voice and behavior. I understand how he went through a rough time in Warrior Within, and after his victory over death he felt free once again... but it just felt like he went from 18 (Sands of Time) to 24 (Warrior Within) back to 18 in Two Thrones. It didn't feel right.<br /><br />One other criticism I have is the speed kill system. Although an interesting concept, it was rather poorly executed, from several standpoints. Firstly, it is painfully repetitive. Fight 5-10 creatures, and you already got enough of it. Not to mention that it's incredibly frustrating to screw up a speed kill, and then be forced to fight your target with the incredibly ineffective dagger, from which the targets take no damage. Bosses liven things up a bit, since most of them are a bit more dynamic, but the bosses are so few and far between it didn't really feel like the trade-off of 5 hours of repetitive gameplay to get me to one dynamic part was worth it. A system where I could be able to build my own combos would of been orgasmic, but I guess that's just too much wishful thinking.<br /><br />My last criticism would be pointed at the game's linearity. Throughout development, we were promised free-roaming through the streets of Babylon. What we were served was one of the most linear experiences in the past 2-3 years in video games. Oh, and the game itself is so criminally short it can be finished in 5 hours, whereas Warrior Within or Sands of Time take a solid 10+ hours.<br /><br />Overall it was as good a game as the other Prince of Persia titles, one of the best of 2005 as well, but it was much less than we were promised, and WAY LESS than I had anticipated. For all the praise it got, it makes me wonder about the gaming community.<br /><br />(Edited on 2nd December 2008, original on Febuary 2006)",unsup
10541_0,okay first of all what happened to the bad ass Kalina she is now an old whore who is aways calm but in the second game she was evil twist did whatever the *bleep* she wanted she didn't care who she hurt or how it was done she would do anything to save herself. next is the prince himself he was sissified since the second game now he is stupid and who ever voices him should burn inf *bleeping* hell! the awesome sound track from the second is replaced with the worst band in history maybe i did make the mistake of playing the second game first but it did rule. i really tried to like this game but i just couldn't. but there is no fun in this game this game is garbage and the controls suck and the camera is bad when you try to move it up or down and the story is the worst of the seris.,unsup
10542_0,"The Two Thrones is the third and last installment in the Prince of Persia trilogy that started three years ago with the astonishing Sands of Time, a game that turned the popular 2D platform series into a complete and spectacular 3D adventure. Jumping, swinging, grasping, hanging off ledges, solving puzzles and graceful combat made up for one of the best games I ever played. Now I know that many people weren't too happy with the dark and grim atmosphere in Warrior Within, but I was actually quite satisfied with this new style. The extremely spectacular free-fight system that came with it, allowing the player to battle up to 6 enemies at the same time, was especially noteworthy, as well as the great storyline that kept twisting and turning in unexpected ways.<br /><br />The Two Thrones returns to the sunny style of SoT, with minimal bloodshed and less body parts flying around. The Prince has defied death on the Island of Time, and is returning to his hometown of Babylon, only to find a fierce army murdering and looting its way through the city. It doesn't take long for the Prince to once again go on a quest to destroy evil and restore peace. The Sands of Time, however, have altered him slightly, causing him to change into a dark alter ego, the Dark Prince, from time to time. This is a nice way of bringing some innovation to the game play, as the Dark Prince makes use of a particularly vicious razor-chain, that allows him to make long jumps and dispose of his enemies much more efficiently. Yet, it does not revolutionize the game play as much as I hoped for. Changing into the Dark Prince happens when the story calls for it, not when the player wants it. Life energy slowly diminishes when playing the Dark Prince, which gives a certain amount of pressure to move and waste enemies fast in order to replenish energy quickly, but we already saw something like this in WW, when playing as the Sand Wraith. Other innovations include the speed kills, which enables the player to kill an enemy with a few strokes, and adds a little stealth to the existing game play. It is nice that you can use this techniques to quickly get rid of a few enemies when you are faced with many, but there isn't much variation in speed kill moves, and it takes away a lot of opportunity to go into an adrenalin-pumping free-fight frenzy. Speed kills become much more varied and useful when fighting the mini-bosses, and the resulting battles are quite spectacular to see.<br /><br />The same can be said from the chariot races that you can do once every while. But just like the Dark Prince appearances, they come only incidentally and they're over just when they become fun. Most of these innovations feel like nice extras instead of fully integrated new parts of the game play, like the 3D platform action and free-fight system.<br /><br />There are more aspects of the game that give the impression that development of TT was slightly rushed. The story is very straightforward this time, and lacks most of the exiting twists that were so prominent in SoT and WW. As a result, the game is only half as long as Warrior and can be finished in mere days instead of weeks. The graphics and FMVs are okay most of the time, but the in-game cut-scenes look at best five year old. Did production run out of polygons? When not playing as the Dark Prince or riding a chariot, I found that jumping and running along walls was getting a bit monotonous after the two previous games; difficult puzzles are scarce, and finding solutions to situations becomes increasingly simple, with only speed kills offering some variance most of the time. The influence of Jordan Mechner, who wrote history with the original PoP and rewrote it with SoT, is dearly missed at some times.<br /><br />But as harsh as this all may sound, by no means does this make TT a bad game; it merely prevents this game from becoming a masterpiece like SoT and (to a lesser degree) WW. Although the thrills I got from playing its predecessors were a bit absent, I still got a good time playing TT. Even though not masterly, it is at the very least competently made.",unsup
10543_0,"This completes the new series, and takes the consequence of the ones before it, similar to how Warrior Within(the saving method of which this retains) built on the first. It has elements of both of them, and adds quite a lot(and far more than aforementioned earlier sequel). You may still wield two weapons, but now the choice of the other one... sword, mace, dagger or axe... affects the way you do so, in the range, force, etc. of the blows. There are still many different ones within those four kinds. The Free Form Fighting System is also still in use, so spamming powerful attacks is still possible, however, this comes closer to The Sands of Time in the combat, with more strategy and tactics necessary, among other things because of those archers... arrows in general are present in this, and they are very welcome. The battles are longer and tougher, and do not get tedious like they did in the one immediately preceding this. Making things interesting is also the fact that you no longer use a lengthy blade as usual... and I will leave it at that, lest I spoil something. One can also tell that the good people at Ubisoft had Splinter Cell on their mind... a couple of the new moves are right out of those, and stealth is a genuine option at several places. They make it work, and it doesn't stand out as (much as) one might think. Speed Kills are part of this... and no, that's not a campaign telling us to slow down on the freeway, nor one against that particular drug. It's a way to take out opponents, typically when they aren't yet aware of your proximity, and all you truly need is to get the timing right, albeit the first time you try the specific ones, before you know what's coming, you will have to react split-second, as well as not get trigger-happy. It works impeccably well, and really adds to this. The Bosses vary, but at their best, they're incredible. The plot is great, picking up where the last one left off, confirming which of the endings they used, and taking you through one place that had yet to be visited in these three... The Prince's home, Babylon. Only it's not how he remembers it, and you'll soon find out why. The idea is magnificent, and making your way through the city is entertaining. As a character, he grows and develops a lot in this, and this really does close this version, these post-2000 entries, well. The voice acting is all satisfactory. Yuri is back, and thankfully, he left the vast majority of the emo back in the first one, but he did bring the humor with him, as well as what comes of his inner talks with his... other half(who's got a nasty case of cynicism). Yes. In this, you also get to control the Dark side of the leading man sometimes, who's stronger, but whose life gradually drains, one of the aspects of this making for serious tension. Does the word Daggertail mean anything to you? Once you've gotten to use it in this, it definitely will. It is a lot of fun, downright addictive, and a marvelous spice for the squaring off against enemies(and it can be used at points for maneuvering, marvelous). You once again get to use the special abilities. The chariot racing is pure awesomeness captured perfectly. The foes are relatively diverse, and less annoying than those of WW. The camera is a little limited, compared to the ones before this, and the panoramic view is less available, and once or twice, even kinda phoned in. The story-telling is similar to SoT. This gets you into it the fastest, and is also the shortest of them. There are graphic glitches and even bugs beyond the others, and it is sadly not as stable, either. This can be disturbing, though it is not as bleak as the second one. There are grotesque creatures herein. The tone is a mix of the others. The style is achieved well, and this uses slow-motion rather well. This also requires patience, reflexes, fingers adept at VG's, and time. The AI is nice, in that they all respond and act the way you'd expect them to. The re-playability is reasonable, you earn Sand Credits as you go, and if you get them all, you will unlock everything, in all of the artwork galleries. And you may just gain something else, as well. The videos(sadly, sans subtitles, although mostly, you can tell what's said) become available upon completion, all but one are the ones you watched along the way in this, and that one is an absolutely hilarious, if criminally brief, gag reel. The cut-scenes are well-done, and can be fairly effective. The CGI is utterly stunning. The animation and look of everything is fantastic. The level design is perhaps the tiniest step down from earlier in these, here and there, but overall it remains at the high quality of them. They utilize the new moves and acrobatics unbelievably well. The puzzles are still well-done, and this can be challenging, and should satisfy a decent range of people, with three difficulty settings. Do you like those ledges that fall off after you step on them? Well, they've made a triumphant return. The audio is well-done, everything sounds the way it should, and the music is nice. The heavy metal of the middle chapter is gone. The attitude towards nudity in this is the same as the earlier two, but it does somehow seem less provocative. The violence is debatable, but there is some blood. There is next to no gore. Language is nonexistent. I recommend this, and the entire franchise up to this point(the pre-beginning of new millennium-ones are immensely well-done, as well, they just happen to be old, and you can tell), to any fan of action-adventure titles, anyone who enjoys the culture, and all who appreciate swordsmanship in games. 8/10",unsup
10544_0,"its a wonderful continuation of the pop series and presents a befitting end to the series.The prince looks great as ever and the various new features which are present in this game add an extra spice to it.The speed kill system is wonderful and makes the job quite easy for the prince,also in this game i cant recall a single instant where the game presented bad camera angles as are present in the previous two games.The game play is although pretty much similar to the previous two games but the platforming in this one is really great.There is one more added attraction in this game that is chariot racing which is quite nail biting stuff.Also in this game there aren't any monotonous boss fights as were in the pop warrior within.All in all a wonderful gaming experience,a must play for everyone and i give it a well deserved 9.5/10.",unsup
10545_0,"Yes, this game is the final installment for this particular prince of Persia, a new one is waiting in the wings. However, as far as this prince is concerned this is the best game he is in. The reason, it does the best job incorporating the fighting and the acrobatics the best of the three. Basically, the fighting is fun and you have plenty of the wall running to really keep you entertained. Throw into that more boss fights than the previous two installments could muster and a nice little change in the prince as he becomes a dark self. It even has the addition of stealth kills that are easy to do and look very cool. The game is a bit short though, and the way it picked up with the sorceress of time alive as she died on the only play through I did in Warrior Within. Which means you should not make your game multiple ending and pick up only one of the possible endings in the next installment. So here we have an old villain emerge, an old ally emerge and a very dark side of the prince emerge. The dark prince side is rather cool and can slice and dice opponents very effectively. His main drawback is that water is a weakness of his and he slowly but surely runs out of health. Still he can replenish it by killing enemies and he does that quite well. The regular prince is still effective to at what he does and fighting and stealth kills are his thing too. You do not go over the same territory in this one like in Within so the game remains fresh. There is a chariot race like scene in this one, but not that great. It is okay, but it does not really add anything. So for my money all in all this is the best of the three prince of Persia games.",unsup
10546_0,"This is the first video game I've ever rated or commented on, but this game was so cool I had to put in my two cents. I don't play video games much at all, but every two years or so I will get the jones to play a game. I'd say the past ten years or so it has been discouraging because these video games are so difficult to learn and play. I grew up on Atari and Nintendo when you had just a couple of buttons and very simple tasks. Once Super Nintendo came on the scene my video game days were almost over.<br /><br />Even still, I decided to give Prince of Persia a shot. Bear in mind, I chose this video game solely based upon a t.v. commercial. I'm not in tuned with video games and the latest and hottest, I just pick up what I see advertised. I knew that I was going to have trouble, but I stuck in there and eventually I got the hang of it.... Scratch that... eventually I GOT ADDICTED. I took the game to work, I played endlessly trying to beat that game. I couldn't put it down it was so captivating. The graphics were awesome, the movements were smooth and cool, and the fact that his fighting was hand to hand combat instead of shooting just made it that much better. He had kill moves that could be done with button combos which reminded me of my Street Fighter 2 days, and that speed kill feature is off da hook, crazy nice. There was a good story that went along with the game. The different obstacles and moves were just difficult enough to where I couldn't overcome them the first time around, but they weren't so difficult that I had to give up. Fighting the opponents was the same, and when the prince turned into the Dark Prince the fun was just beginning.<br /><br />Like I said, I have very little reference for a good game versus a bad one, but this game was lovely. I eventually beat it in what was a short time for me (it had to have been weeks). The ending was even amazing, and I didn't know that games had credits longer than most movies.",unsup

10549_0,"I love shows with simple concepts. The show is carried by Tim, an ordinary 25 year old New Yorker who works in an office. He has the worst luck. Tim is always getting caught in horribly embarrassing and incriminating situations, that are the centre of the show. I would compare it to Curb Your Enthusiasm in the way that it brilliantly sets up it's scenarios, the build-up and the over-the-top conclusions.<br /><br />This show is animated and usually people wouldn't be interested in watching new ones, fearful that it's another Seth MacFarlane show or a show that's trying to mimic the style of a MacFarlane show. The Life and Times of Tim is an adult cartoon that Seth MacFarlane has no involvement in. If Family Guy pushes the envelope, Tim goes even further. This is HBO we're talking about here, they have nothing but quality, uncensored programing. This is no exception. It also happens to be HBO's first animated series since Spawn. This is the best animated series in the last 5 years.<br /><br />The animation isn't amazing. In fact, it's pretty awful looking, but that works in it's favor. It's not a very fast paced show, some people may even find it boring. They could show you the most boring office cubicle on Television because of the drawing style.<br /><br />Like I said the show certainly won't be for everyone. If you need to be constantly entertained with non-stop action in your cartoons, than this won't be for you. If you are patient, like you have to be to watch shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm, you should give this a chance. The second season just started and you can be able to jump in without having any knowledge about the characters. It's a huge strength for a show to be able to watch the segments in a random order. It's only a half-hour show and each story is 15 minutes, so it's not a huge commitment.",unsup

So my comment will probably be linked to the two films rather than only to this particularly strange journey, adrift in a Parisian's tramp mind. War is the main thread that links his dreams, as he embodies a medieval king, or a communist leader, or remembers of his east-european country, ravaged by war. But more interesting is the permanent obsession, for Iosseliani, of typical features like Cinema in itself, Paris, where the director actually lives (he's from Georgia), tramps, alcohol and songs. The scenes which I think are 'real' in opposition to 'dreamt' ones, mainly show the hero, with his unfortunate friends, but still happy singing beautiful harmonies. Just like the last scene (and others) from ""Adieu,.."". It is a bit difficult to follow the plot, since there are so many different ages edited together, but as the very first sequence shows us, this is only Cinema. So just let your mind wander with the pictures.",unsup

I haven't laughed out loud this much since arrested development (R.I.P.) and the humor is similarly fast paced and, at times, absurd.

The show follows Tim, who is frequently caught in admittedly outlandish situations, although they always seem to spiral out of control so realistically. He and the supporting cast of characters all have their own stand out performances, including Debbie the friend/hooker and Amy the girlfriend, who is perpetually disappointed in her well-meaning but just plain awful boyfriend.

This unbalance extends to the sets for whereas the three cafes that figure in the action are all utility Thesiger's apartment is well-appointed in the extreme.

The camera starts on his hands, so you only see what he's doing-- pasting newspaper clippings about lurid murders into a scrapbook-- but when his face is finally revealed, the whole audience seemed to sit a bit straighter, and we stayed that way through the end, reacting with open delight to this character's every movement, his every phrase.<br /><br />I mean to take nothing away from the star of the film, Emlyn Williams (who wrote almost as many films as he starred in), but Ernest Thesiger was capable of turning a lousy movie into a watchable one, and a good movie into an unforgettable one.

10557_0,"The 1938 British noir suspenser 'They Drive by Night' is one of the best films I've ever seen. First, let's address that title: is this movie related to the same-named 1940 Humphrey Bogart movie? Yes, but very distantly. The 1938 'They Drive by Night' was produced by Warner Brothers' British unit, and offered for distribution Stateside. Jack L Warner declined to release this film in the States (he must have been insane!) ... but he was impressed by its title, and he ordered one of his American production units to make a film with that title. Of all the Hollywood studios, Warners were the most efficient at cannibalising their own material: the American 'They Drive by Night' is partially a warmed-over remake of the earlier Warners film 'Bordertown'. Both ""Drive by Night""s depict the culture of long-distance lorry drivers ... but the British film captures that dark world much more believably.<br /><br />'They Drive by Night' (the British one) is occasionally compared to Hitchcock's 'Frenzy' (both films deal with a sex maniac who uses his necktie to strangle women, and both depict an innocent man caught in the middle), but 'They Drive by Night' more closely resembles the novel by Arthur La Bern on which 'Frenzy' was based. (Unlike Hitchcock's film, the source novel takes place shortly after World War Two.) Emlyn Williams gives a standout performance as Shorty, a petty criminal who has just been released from prison, and who goes straight away to look up an old girlfriend. When he gets to her walk-up bedsit, he discovers she's just been killed by a sex murderer ... and the circumstances of the murder make Shorty the logical suspect. In Hitchcockian fashion, he tries to stay one jump ahead of the police while seeking the real killer.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT. The scene in which Shorty tries to waken his sleeping girlfriend ... only to discover that she's actually dead, and THEN to discover that she's been murdered ... is one of the most powerful sequences ever captured on film. As the horror of the situation sinks in, Shorty stands silently ... and far away, elsewhere in London, we hear a church clock chiming the hour. Pure brilliant, that is.<br /><br />That wizened old ham actor Ernest Thesiger gives one of his ripest performances in this film ... and it's giving nothing away to reveal that Thesiger plays the murderer. He makes his first appearance late in the film, but the first time we see him he's lovingly updating his scrapbook of newspaper cuttings concerning the Necktie Strangler. Later, confronted by some damp kittens, he fusses over them ridiculously. ('Oh, the little imps!') My only complaint against Thesiger's performance is that the character he plays in this film is so swishy and effeminate (just as Thesiger was, in real life), I couldn't believe that he had any sexual interest in women ... even as murder victims.<br /><br />'They Drive by Night' was directed by Arthur Woods, whose extremely promising career ended far too soon. (He was killed in action during the war.) I've no doubt that, if Woods had made films for only ten years more, he would be recognised as indisputably one of the very greatest film directors. I rate this fast-paced noir thriller 10 points out of 10 ... but it really ought to be rated an eleven!<br /><br />",unsup
10558_0,"""They Drive By Night"" is difficult to find (as are many pre World War II British titles) but well worth the effort. What starts out as a standard crime drama takes a startling turn into horror in the final reel.<br /><br />Ernest Thesiger (best known as Dr.Pretorius in 1935's ""Bride of Frankenstein"") adds the most interesting element to the film and to share any more would ruin the fun.<br /><br />Emlyn Williams as ex-con Shorty Matthews carries the film. Pity this poor fellow...he has the worst luck in the world. Upon release from prison, his intention is to return to the arms of his girlfriend. Unfortunately, someone has murdered her that very day. Naturally, police think he is the killer.<br /><br />Shorty takes to the road, hitchhiking rides with truck drivers, hoping to stay free long enough for the police to find the real killer. One of the uncredited stars of this film has to be rain! The constant pouring rain accentuates Shorty's troubles as he tries to clear his name and (excuse the pun) adds buckets of atmosphere to the movie.<br /><br />Don't confuse the British ""They Drive by Night"" with the later US version starring Humphrey Bogart. The only thing they have in common is the presence of truck drivers.",unsup

1055_0,"One of Director Otar Iosseliani's stronger films. The movie takes place during several periods of time in his native country of Georgia: in the Middle Ages, in the early 1900s, during the Stalinist period (the bulk of the movie) and in the chaos of the early 1990s. The same actors often play different characters at the different periods of time (for example, the guy playing the medieval king also plays a Stalinist henchman and a contemporary smuggler). The movie works through vignettes full of deadpan humor, and a common thread of all the stories seems to be the absurdity of life, the arrogance of power and man's inhumanity to man. Iosseliani even plays a couple of roles here, as a Stalinist torturer, and as a present day bumbling projectionist, in one of the film's most elaborate gags. Overall, a great movie, with Iosseliani's caustic humor telling us, as the old Latin proverb said, that homo homini lupus, man is a wolf to man.",unsup

It takes you on a roller coaster ride through time, forwards backwards sideways - sideways? Well OK sometimes you have to follow the plot closely but the people who got confused might be better off watching a straight space blaster. This is clever film making no mistake. And what's with the crazy criticism of the director Davis van Eyssen? This guy obviously has talent in spades and manages to create something that is visually stunning and exciting but that also carefully defines real characters and emotion.

I'm surprised to read here that the director David van Eyssen worked on such a small budget but I suppose necessity is the mother of invention as they say. Maybe it helps to restrict the budget and what you have here is an interesting example of something between indie and full blown Hollywood feature that relies on performances, script and directive skill rather than throwing cash at a slim idea to make yet another bland effects fest.

10565_0,"Poor old Sean Astin. Hot off the success of LOTR he ends up doing this dull excuse for an action sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Slipstream is dull. Not boring, just dull. I had hoped for more seeing as how Vinnie Jones was in it. But he is horribly hamstrung by not being able to swear properly. Substitutions for the F-Word such as ""flaming"" just aren't funny when they come out of his mouth. Reminded me all to much of a network version of Aliens I saw some years ago, where Hudson kept saying ""Frickin'-A!"" in a completely different voice than Bill Paxton's. At least here they got Vinnie to do the words. But it still sounds just wrong! Because of this, Vinnie isn't remotely funny in this film. Sean seems terribly ill at ease and the rest of the cast do nothing spectacular. In short, the movie is just dull.<br /><br />I don't mind the silly physics of time travel, but I do dislike lack of common sense when movies are made. Here, we are told that the time-travel window to the past is just ten minutes long - something to do, we find out later, with not having enough power. But dear old Sam - sorry, Sean - has no problem using his device several times over in those ten minutes, effectively going back over the same ten minutes again and again. So it begs the question....if you can use the device repeatedly, why not go back 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes.... and so on? All in all, poorly thought out and badly executed.

You can see it in the visual language of the film, Japanimation translated into live action complete with all the camera moves, larger than life characters and primary color scheme. If you have a chance to see it in a theatre, as I did, go.<br /><br />Slipstream's not about the real world but an alternative universe where time lost can be time regained and all your past mistakes erased. But it's not Primer and it's not meant to be. It's not exactly a spoof either -- more of a celebration parody of the sci fi action genre. <br /><br />While it's ninety odd minutes of fast-paced entertainment on the one hand it doesn't take a genius to detect something else at work here, beneath the surface, a straight to video title actually intended for the initiated, the film literate. Note the Sergio Leone style soundtrack during the bank robbery. The glint in the actors' eyes when they deliver their lines. Vinny Jones' performance says it all, deliberately cockney and spoofing the Lock, Stock persona to perfection. And Astin's not far behind -- anyone notice the line on the plane when they're all about to go to hell in a handbasket? ""Oh, yeah.. the plane's about to crash so I better do something!"". If you don't get it by then you really weren't watching.<br /><br />Read between the lines and you'll begin to see that this is a film about the sci-fi genre and about action films in general. If you don't get that, you've missed the point. Restart the DVD and watch it again. And maybe you'll really enjoy it this time. Don't be fooled, this is imaginative stuff and not your run of the mill heavy TV scifi. The last thing Slipstream does is take itself seriously.

But in the end, I just had to, because I'm an absolute science fiction lover- so I took the risk.<br /><br />When the movie starts you immediately see that this is no B-movie. The special effects are of a high standard, the acting is like you may expect from Hollywood actors and the music is damn good. This movie could very well have played in theaters, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />So, why do I give it a 7 and not an 8? I give an 8 only to movies that still make me think about them the next day; and when I feel that I have to recommend them to others in the confidence that they will like it too. The only reason, therefore, that this movie isn't an 8 is because I LIKED the movie - but I'll probably have forgotten about it tomorrow. The idea behind the movie: someone has a small device that can take them back in time a few minutes-- could have served for some master plot that gets more and more complex, with twists and Ooohs and Aaahs-- making you laugh out loud, thinking ""Why didn't I think about that?"" and ""Can it get ANY more complex/genius?""... But instead, that doesn't happen. The movie doesn't really explore a new level of story line, only possible with time travel. Afterwards you have the satisfaction that you have when you just saw another good bank robbery movie, or a hijack movie. Fun, but no more than that.

1056_0,"I am giving Brigands the highest mark. However, I believe it is virtually impossible to appreciate the movie without sufficient knowledge of Soviet history and perhaps some involvement into Perestroika and post Perestroika cultural context.<br /><br />The film is an antithesis to very famous movie by Tengiz Abuladze (also a Georgian as Iosseliani) Monanieba (Confession). The later was one of the first attempts to rethink and reevaluate the past involvements of all layers of society in Stalin terror. It was of special significance that a Georgian has made such a film because Stalin even until now possesses a status of icon in his home country. Confession took a stance that all that had happened was a great tragedy and everybody was guilty to have let it happened.<br /><br />Brigands, on the other hand, portraits the Stalin terror as something very mundane and boring, pushing a viewer to only one logical conclusion that it was unavoidable having in mind that authorities in all times had been no more than ordinary brigands, gangsters and robbers. Iosseliani uses the same cast to play historically parallel roles from medieval Georgia to the very recent events of collapse or the Soviet Union. The same actors and repeating at least in spirit parallel events create some static recognizable core in seemingly distant and different stories.<br /><br />The film appeals to various known historical facts such as personal Stalin involvement in criminal acts of bank robberies before Bolsheviks had noticed him.<br /><br />It is a masterpiece in both cinematographic and philosophic way.",unsup
10570_0,"Recap: Stuart Conway, a talented programmer, has designed a cell-phone looking time machine. As he is not very popular anywhere he works, he decides to use the machine in a fraud, to repeatedly cash a paycheck in a bank. Interestingly enough he chooses his one and only love interest as the teller (imagine how happy she would be when she found out that he had been tricking her). Anyway, the FBI suspects Conway is up to something and agents Sarah Tanner and Jake Hallman, an item outside work as well, is at the bank watching him. Unfortunately for them, Winston Briggs and his gang has decided to rob the place. At first, Conway get shot after Tanner tries to stop the robbery, but he, with the help of Tanner only rewinds time. Second time it is instead Hallman that is fatally wounded, and this time Winston steals the time machine, although he doesn't know what it is. Tanner's only chance to save her love is Conway's machine, and she forces him to come with her and go after the machine.<br /><br />Comment: A very interesting idea this, with the time altering and the robbery and all. Time travel is very tricky business however, and not surprisingly this movie gets it wrong. And by wrong, I mean they contradict themselves. For instance it is said that all that touches the machine and those and that who touches the one holding the machine goes back in time. All other don't remember the time altering. This is how the fraud works. Conway gets the money, holds them (but not the check) and rewinds the time, and then cashes the check again, still holding the money for the first time. But in the end (do not read further if you don't want to know the end) Tanner is saved when Conway, who is shot, activating the machine. But Tanner is touching Conway and should therefore not be affected by the time travel. That is she should still be wounded after the time jump. In fact, Conway himself is returned from the dead in this way, and there it is very important that he didn't have any contact with the machine. There are more examples, very evident ones, that should have been detected and corrected by the crew if they had any intention in doing a movie of decent quality. Worse still though is the behaviour of the police. I don't think there is one gunfight were the officers in the line of fire tries to get behind cover. In fact, it is rare that they even crouch to make a smaller target (this is also somewhat true for the robbers) having absolutely no thought about surviving the fight. Luckily enough, all involved is the worst shooters of all time and wouldn't hit a house if they were standing inside it. So the casualty rate is surprisingly low. In addition to that, they seem amateurish enough that they don't search a robber that has actually been shot (maybe they were so surprised they forgot), making it possible for Tanner not just to retrieve a vital clue but also a loaded gun from a corpse about to be sent to the morgue. All my hopes for the movie disappeared then.<br /><br />It should be said though that there are some positive things. As said above, the idea is brilliant. The introduction, albeit a little slow, is beautiful and thoughtful. And I have no complaints about the special effects, in fact most of them are very good. But it can't make up for all the flaws in the story.<br /><br />4/10",unsup

They follow him to a bank, where he withdraws something like $2000, and then begins hitting of the teller. It then shows him turning on his ""palm pilot"" and follows by the teller throwing her drink at him. He touches the ""palm pilot"" and time stops. He is just able to touch her drink before time begins to reverse and it goes back to her giving him the money.

First, Sean Astin spends about 10 minutes of the film trying to hit on the female bank teller. His lines are so creepy, but his face and manner seems so normal, it is not convincing. The first 10 minutes and I already was disgusted by the hero, who kept using his time-travel device to go back 10 minutes and, (like Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"") think of better lines to pick her up. But the pick-up lines go from bad to worse: ""You are like a peach. So ripe. I want to just eat you,"" to, "" All I can think of is how you look in black lace panties"". Some genius. Supposed to be funny, but it's not. This icky courtship by the wunderkind is just repellent to watch, and already in the first 10 minutes, I hated the main character (Astin)! The female FBI agent gets hold of Astin's time machine device (which looks like a hand-held clear plastic cellphone/compass), realizes its power, and then..even though she knows there's going to be a takeover bank robbery in seconds, proceeds to... arrest Sean Astin?? And why 2 FBI agents would stand up in a bank and start firing their pistols at 4 body-armored, machine-gun wielding robbers, endangering everyone else in the bank unnecessarily is beyond me. But they do, and the film makes this already unbelievable sequence last for about 15 minutes with Matrix-like rotating-camera effects which make the heads appear more like video game AI avatars that fire at you in slow-mo, nobody getting hit the whole time. It's surreal and stupid. The lead robber makes a getaway (purloining the device), and leaves his friends in the bank--NO--they're already in the van, OK. So they drive away with the loot (or without? who cares!!) and end up crashing the van even though they are not being chased! They survive a tumbling crash without a single broken bone, even though they weren't wearing their seat belts. They get out, and instead of carjacking someone, they decide to...hijack a busload of people until the authorities arrive!

I loved Sean Astin's speech at the beginning which reminded me of some of the best moments from Blade Runner or 2001 but I also enjoyed the sheer energy of the film. Another thing I loved was the strong character played by Ivana Milicervic. As a female Sci-Fi fan (not the only one surely!!) it's great to see a woman kick butt especially against a guy like Vinnie Jones! My favourite part of the film was near the end - don't worry no spoiler here!! - but suffice to say there are some amazing visuals that combine with a clever story tie up and soaring score to make for a pretty spectacular climax. Don't miss this one or you'll be sorry.<br /><br />Laetitia,unsup
1057_0,"I seem to be in the minority here. I can't understand why this<br /><br />movie isn't getting the most enthusiastic reviews.<br /><br />Sure, the plot has been visited again and again in books, movies<br /><br />and TV (including Richard Basehart's mind being taken over at<br /><br />least 34 times in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea). Does that<br /><br />matter so much? Haven't we seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""A.I.""<br /><br />before? Did anyone criticize them as ""just another Longest Day,""<br /><br />or ""just another 'robot wants to be human'"" movies?<br /><br />The Puppet Masters is expertly handled. The direction is tight and<br /><br />suspense-building. The early scenes of the kids with the UFO<br /><br />roadside attraction are clever. Sutherland is great. The dialogue<br /><br />is realistic. This remains one of my favorites",unsup
10580_0,"I really believe a fourth grader could have written better dialog and plot. The idea for this movie creates tremendous potential which is totally wasted on sheer stupidity of conversation and illogical plot. Movies involving time travel can be tricky but if done right, can also be very thought provoking. This movie doesn't even try to go there. This movie, like so many scifi's today, is overly focused on special effects with the plot and dialog treated as an afterthought. I'll have to remember the name, David Van Eyssen, and make concerted efforts NOT to watch anything directed by him. Foolish waste of time. I really have nothing more to say about this movie but the submission filter wants more lines. So here they are.",unsup
10581_0,"The relatively bad rating didn't stop me from watching this movie. I like sci-fi movies and time travelling is also compelling! As many people have stated here, the movie was off to a good start and all was well. However, this ended when with the spinning camera scene inside the bank. Totally ridiculous and uncalled for.<br /><br />After that the story never really evolved and instead all we saw was a bad action movie without a shred of tension... I agree - they totally wasted a good idea for a movie! As one guy said before me, I too would like to travel back to before I watched this movie.<br /><br />There are a lot of good comments about this movie, most of which are suspiciously positive about things in this movie that there really cannot be any discussion about whether they're good or not... I believe these people are giving us their subjective thoughts derived from their involvement in this project and therefore they are not to be trusted.<br /><br />If you're interested in irritating flaws in this movie, you should read some of the other negative reviews really. It's all been said before. However, there is one thing I was wondering about. I'm far from an airplane expert, but would a plane really crash if someone fired a shout through one of the windows? Sure, it might be a bit windy in the cabin, but even that shouldn't be a problem due to the low altitude at which they were flying at the time. No air masks would be necessary anyway. As I said, i'm no expert, but this just seems wrong.<br /><br />Finally, I'd just like to say that when Astin's character managed to drop the time travel PDA thingumajig for like the eleventh time, I really started to hate him...<br /><br />3/10",unsup
10582_0,"I cannot believe that anybody would rate this movie as even watchable, as I found it unbearably annoying and felt like jumping out a window 20 minutes in. It stars 2 actors whom I've thoroughly enjoyed in previous movies, Sean Astin (lotr fame, Rudy, Harrison Bergeron) and Vinnie Jones (of the guy Richie films lock stock and two smoking barrels and snatch), but they are put to utter waste. First and foremost the dialogue is horrendous. I found myself rolling my eyes at at every line coming out of more than a few characters, and the impossible stubbornness of a character towards certain situations was likable to them needing a person to fly by way of flapping their arms, and not taking no as an answer. The most idiotic and annoying aspect of the film is something that happens all throughout, making it consistently stupid. imagine a gunfight with 2 people standing 6 feet apart, firing away at each other in slow motion, and both missing. stupid right? imagine another 2 people to whom self-preservation is obviously #1, running out of a pair of doors, guns blazing into a sea of armed individuals, with big grins on their faces. All throughout this movie any scene in which a gun is fired is filmed in the stupidest most unrealistic way. everybody opens fire standing right out in the open with no cover, not flinching in the least as bullets fly by their heads. The most disturbing scene I found was one in which a group of 5 armed individuals are on a stationary bus in which they have taken many hostages, open up fire on the police, and the police return fire with no regard whatsoever for the hostages! Like I said, stupid movie, I feel stupider after watching it, and I would recommend it to nobody.",unsup
10583_0,"Just watched this on DVD. Potentially a good idea, spoiled by woeful direction and some of the worst acting I have seen outside of a school play. Sean Astin puts in a reasonable performance and Vinnie Jones tries hard, but the rest of the cast was appalling. It's almost as if the principal cast was signed up, locations scouted, and then they knocked on doors at their locations and asked people if they wanted to be in a movie. The story had promise but it all fell in a heap. Awful. Time travel movies can tend to be disjointed, but if it's done well it all makes sense in the end. This makes sense it just doesn't seem worth the effort of watching. I ended up sticking with it till the end and was not rewarded for my efforts.",unsup
10584_0,"I saw Slipstream at its World Premiere in London a few days ago and I'm quite surprised it didn't get a general release. The film has its faults but it maintained my interest to the end and was both well acted and stylishly directed. The time travel concept doesn't altogether add up and there is one sequence which still doesn't make any sense to me but this is science fiction and how many action films make much sense anyway? The important thing is it's good entertainment and thought provoking to boot. I would have preferred less shooting and exploding, especially in slow motion which makes for some confusion with the time travel sequences, and less bad language but these are minor complaints.<br /><br />The best thing about Slipstream is its strong performances. Sean Astin can always be relied upon to put in a great characterisation and he makes the scientist hero Stuart likable and funny despite being dishonest, cowardly and nerdy. A very pleasant surprise given the film's violence is how funny it is, and Sean Astin is the main reason for this. His subtlety ensures that for the most part there isn't too much of a clash of tone between the action and the comedy and the movie's generous use of close-ups takes full advantage of his facial expressiveness. Indeed the film is a real treat for Sean's many female admirers; he cuts a fine dash in pilot's uniform, not to mention some impressively tight jeans! He dominates the film with his charisma and charm, giving it most of its heart, proving once again his ability to carry a film despite so rarely being given the chance to do so. Nor is he let down by the rest of the cast. Ivana Milicevic (from Paycheck) does a good job as Sarah the tough FBI officer, interacting effectively with Astin. Most surprising was how good Vinnie Jones was as the villain, making an entertaining combination of malice and humour. This was the only aspect where the different tones of the drama sat together awkwardly however; the crooks are a seriously vicious bunch (I could have done without the exploding bus driver; I hope this wasn't meant to be funny) but humour is used to make them at least a little bit sympathetic. Nevertheless in retrospect this doesn't turn out to be too much of a problem because of how the film ends.<br /><br />One of the best features of Slipstream is its strong visual imagery. Sometimes it overreaches itself and becomes a little self-indulgent and disorienting but sometimes it is so striking it's almost poetic, especially a truly remarkable shot of a plane paused in motion as it crashes vertically into a mountain offset by a full moon. The script is serviceable and frequently witty. There is plenty of action and some genuine suspense. The ending remains in doubt until the final denouement. This isn't quite convincing but it doesn't really matter. Unusually for an action film you do care about the characters, especially Stuart, even though they themselves seem to care little about the carnage around them, and want them to survive. The final shot is enigmatic but very satisfying both dramatically and visually (especially for the aforementioned Astin admirers) and sends you out on a high. I would certainly want to see this film again, and soon.    ",unsup
10585_0,"As i am alway interested in a sf movie, i picked this one up at the local video rental store. Never heard of slipstream but the 10 minute time travel plot seemed interesting.<br /><br />This movie however fits straight into the top 10 worst movies ever. It really got it all : Very bad acting, small budget, horrible plot and the worst directing ever.<br /><br />The director seems to be in love with guns and slow motion, in this movie you get to see more close-ups of guns than of the actors. Enormous amounts of bullets are shot at each other while standing up and with the actors looking like they are watching TV. No worries however, almost all shots miss completely.<br /><br />Then there is the bus scene where the bad guys take hostages. The bus is supposed to be on a highway. Due to budget restrictions the highway has about 5 other cars on it instead of 500. Furthermore the police action is totally unbelievable.<br /><br />The FBI agent runs around with the main character she just arrested without any regard for his safety. The rest of the police is checking out their guns while the director zooms in on the guns triggers, red dots and what not.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is equally bad and unintentionally funny. The director is only good for making gun commercials.<br /><br />Waste of 80 minutes and 1,60 euro.",unsup
10586_0,"Slipstream obviously is a bad movie. Now there are two types of bad movies. The first is of the Steven Seagal-category: meant to be cheap fun, and that's what it is. Poor film-making, but somehow fun to watch. The second category is where Slipstream fits into: meant to be original, innovative and artful yet all you get is mere pretentious junk. A Steven Seagal-picture knows it's terrible but doesn't want to be any more than terrible. Slipstream tries to be terrific but is actually the opposite, so in the end it's annoying as hell. The whole movie you're thinking: whoever made this should be sent to prison for insulting the intelligence of man. To sum up some of the things that went wrong with this flick: 1) the director uses all kinds of advanced techniques, mostly derived from The Matrix, for no purpose at all (a little like Swordfish but a thousand times worse), 2) the acting is totally unconvincing, people dying everywhere and the protagonists behaving like nothing is the matter, 3) huge plot holes everywhere, 4) an incredible load of editing errors, 5) everything is ripped from other movies, 6) this is the worst thing I've ever seen, 7) you shouldn't watch it, 8) forget all the positive comments around here. Thank you.",unsup
10587_0,"This is the kind of movie that could be decent, but becomes unwatchable because the director's so in love with his/her techniques. The plot's not groundbreaking, but it is different from most time travel movies where you keep going back in time. Unfortunately, the director likes the soundtrack and sloooooow motion so much he keeps using it over and over, resulting in something you may enjoy if you love meaningless pontification on our existence or what-not. That is, the film doesn't provide for it but David what's-his-name probably wants you to ponder and reminisce during the frequent slooow-motion rewinding of history. The premise is hard to believe already. It's a shame he decides to be clever with techniques. Over and over and over again.",unsup
10588_0,"Where do these good reviews come from? With words and phrases like ""accomplished,"" ""mesmerizing,"" ""visually stunning,"" ""reminds me of the best moments from Blade runner and 2001,"" ""Astin acts his heart out."" Sounds to me like some PR people are doing damage control on the old IMDb in the hopes they can salvage some kind of life for this film on DVD. ""I can't believe it wasn't theatrically released."" Well, I can, and we should thank the studio execs who decided to give this movie a basic cable burial. They did so to preserve social harmony. If the general public had paid box office price to watch Slipstream, riots would have surely ensued.<br /><br />Make no mistake, people, this movie is BAD. The amazing directorial technique some seem to be so inexplicably impressed by is nothing but hack. Slow motion is used to signal the slowing down of time before a backwards trip, but it's also just used any old time to signify nothing other than the total running time needed to be longer to qualify as a feature-length film. Then there's the rotating camera. Why use the technique so much? Well they bought the rig, and darn it, they were going to use it. Stupid, horribly staged bank shootout? No worries, we've got a rotating camera. Stupid, horribly written and acted bus bathroom scene? No worries, we've got a rotating camera. And here's a dilemma, we've got two versions of a scene, one with the actors inside a car and one where they're outside, both are horribly written and acted, but we forgot to use the rotating camera. What do we do? No worries, we'll just inter-cut the two separate takes, and the lack of continuity will jar the stupider viewers into thinking that we ""have a visual style."" Yeah, that's right, I've been saying horribly acted. No one, in this movie is a great actor, by which I mean, has a great range. To the Astinites out there, sorry, but your boy is a serviceable actor at best. Without an extraordinary director and extraordinary writing, the mediocrity of Astin's performance is an unbearable distraction. He's had the good fortune to be in a few good movies in his career, but, left to his own devices, he will pick insipid little things like Slipstream simply because the script uses the phrase, ""String Theory."" This is a dangerous trait for a less-than amazing actor to possess. If he wises up, he will accept the role of supporting, character actor with grace. He cannot and should not attempt to carry a film.<br /><br />To give a little credit to the actors, including Astin, there's not much you can do with writing as terrible as this. There are no character arcs to speak of, just starting points and end points. How did they get there? What's the motivation? Who could be that stupid? Who cares! Have you seen our rotating camera? And, to all you aspiring directors, when faced with a script with no feeling and actors phoning it in, don't forget to use slow-motion. It saves the writer from having to write something compelling and the actor from having to emote. The slower you get it, the more emotional weight a scene can carry. And if you manage to have a rotating camera with slow-motion, whoa boy! Oscar can't be far behind. Or at the very least, a BAFTA.<br /><br />I've never, before watching Slipstream, felt it my duty to so harshly trash a film on the internet. I registered with IMDb because of it. Believe it or not, this is me at my most humanistic. Mankind should not have to watch this movie. If I can prevent one person, then I've done my part to make a better world.<br /><br />For the love of all that is good, go rent Donny Darko and stay far away from the abomination known as Slipstream.",unsup

These small alien creatures latch on to human's spines and control their nervous system and their entire bodies. They can shut down their hearts, speak for them and kill them. It's not exactly an original story so I didn't expect much and it wasn't good at all. Also what took away any suspense is every main character was eventually controlled at one point by the aliens.

10590_0,"**(WARNING,SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THE COMMENTS.READ AT YOUR OWN RISK IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!)**Why isn't this on the bottom 100 with the rest of the cr*p?I mean this was so bad,it caused my brain to hurt and bleed.Here is how it began.It picks up where the first left off.Duwayne(spelling correction)and Belial have taken a steep fall from the hotel,and the paramedics pick them up; and place them on the ambulance.They arrive at the hospital to be treated,but they don't stay for long.A person disguised as a hospital worker kidnaps them both,and puts them in a van.She turns out to be Granny Ruth,and both she and her Granddaughter,run a boarding house for freaks.They're introduced first to a three armed gargoyle,with a really bizarre laugh.They are soon introduced to other creatures who are disabled in the ""looks"" department.One of them looks like it had an xylophone crammed up its mouth.Why does another one look like the symbol for ""The Morton Downey Jr.Show""?Its basically a really large mouth that can sing opera,as Granny Ruth demonstrates.One looks like a giant maggot with glasses,another one looks almost like Swamp Thing.There's another one that was really hairraising,and one has to ask questions.What exactly did they do to Mac Tonight?He was a half moon man, that used to be shown on older McDonalds commercials back in the late 80's and early 90's.Was this supposed to be funny?Did they have something against him?It looks like they washed his face with a cheese grater,or an SOS pad.How rude!Then Belial is introduced to a female,reptilian freak named Eve who's an invalid.They later fall in LURVE with each other.Granny says she found her lying beside the road one day.I dunno,but I think she accidently backed over Eve with a Van,while she was crossing the street.Never mind.Duwayne develops a crush on Ruth's granddaughter,Susan,but she refuses his advances.We later see three other freaks,not introduced earlier.Two of them show up in a scene,where Duwayne is examining his scars.The male freak looks like a mouse,and his wife looks like something ripped off from ""Troll"".Another freak that really takes the cake is the frog one.This crossed eyed thing,is seen secretly looking at the reporter.Enough about the freaks,here's what I detest about the movie SO much.First, the freaks and monstrositys look down right stupid and poorly designed.Maybe it was intentional to be funny,or maybe the costume designer has the creativity and skill of a broom handle.Second,one has to question how some of the human freaks came to be;especially the ones like the mouse and frog.The story is weak with some plot holes,and scenes don't make any sense.The mouse freak says ""Uh Oh!"" when he sees Duwayne staring at himself.Why?Belial laughs wickedly after Duwayne explains about wanting to be normal.Again, I ask why?Sure, they had a nosy reporter trying to expose them,but not much else.Gore and violence seems like it was just thrown in, to keep the audience awake.But even the violent scenes are poorly executed.The one liners thrown in by Duwayne after a violent act,made me groan in pain.I wanted to throw rotten eggs at him.At least Freddy Kruger knows how to throw in funny oneliners.Then there is the scene that made me cringe(BRRR).If there's something I never want to see in a movie,its this.I never want to see ugly people naked or have sex,and I never want to see ugly monsters naked or have sex.It had belial and Eve having sex,ARRGHH!Eww, that was something I can live without.I'd rather have my toes cut off!And that painful excuse for violin music sounded like it was played by a dog.Woof!The musical score is Laurie Anderson bad.When Duwayne tries to get it on with Susan,we find out,(SURPRISE)she's a marsupial.And she has a disfigured sock puppet pop in and out of her pouch.The biggest pisser of all, is the fact this was a ripoff of ""Nightbreed"",a much a better movie that came out a few years earlier.The freaks in that movie were better made,plus the story and plotting were well written.Watch ""Nightbreed"" instead of this dreck.0 stars for this junk.",unsup
10591_0,"After the opening credits which are over a cool black and white drawing of Belial where he looks totally different to how he looks in the actual film, Basket Case 2 picks up right where the original Basket Case (1982) left off with Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck, who returns for this sequel) and his deformed mutant Siamese twin brother lying in Times Square in front of the Broslin Hotel having just fell from their room window. They are rushed to hospital. The bizarre event is widely covered by the media. In their mansion and hideaway for various freaks, Granny Ruth Smoeller (Annie Ross) and her granddaughter Susan (Heather Rattray) watch the news broadcasts and decide they should help Duane and Belial. Ruth and Susan find Duane and Belial in front of the hospital as they have just walked out more or less unchallenged. Back at their mansion in New Jersey Ruth and Susan take both Duane and Belial in, make them feel welcome, show them around and introduce them to the other assorted freaks who reside there. Meanwhile back in Manhattan Lou (Jason Evers), the editor of a newspaper called the 'Judge and Jury' is putting pressure on one of his journalists named Marcie Elliott (Kathryn Meisle) to keep the Bradley twins story going as it sells newspapers and suggests she visits an old lady they used to write loads of story's about and who they nicknamed Dr. Freak, real name Ruth Smoeller. Together with her photographer Arty (Matt Mitler) she goes and sees Ruth, while there she also sees Duane and the potential for a really big story for herself. However, Duane, Belial, Ruth and the rest of the freaky residents aren't going to let a snooping reporter expose them and plan to stop her and anyone else she has told, by whatever means necessary!<br /><br />Written and directed by Frank Henenlotter who was also responsible for the original, and like the original I really didn't think too much of it. The script is slightly better paced but at points in the film relegates Duane and Belial to mere cameos, I must confess I did like the ending though, quite a cool sequence to end on. The acting is mostly awful again especially Annie Ross as Granny Ruth, she is embarrassingly bad to watch as she tries to act motherly towards loads of freaks she keeps in the attic and don't get me started on the scene where she delivers a 'rousing' speech to the freaks in her basement they get to via a secret elevator! Duane has really aged since the original that was made 8 years prior to this sequel and because the film is supposed to be set immediately after the events of the original, the way he looked just felt wrong. The make up effects credited to Gabe Bartalos are, in my humble opinion terrible. The freaks themselves are just rubber/foam latex masks that are very silly looking and have very little movement or expression. I just think they look like cheap joke shop masks, very poor. Belial looks totally different in this film too, and he still looks ridiculous. There is very little gore or violence in it, and no nudity or sex. Well human nudity or sex anyway, which brings me to one of the most head-shakingly awful sequences I've ever had the misfortune to see. The sex scene between Belial and his freaky girlfriend Katy! As they grunt and moan they have sex against the sound of romantic piano music, the whole sequence is really embarrassing to watch, not sleazy, not disgusting, not funny and not disturbing just plain cringe-inducingly bad film making by Henenlotter and his crew. The film is a lot more professional looking than the original, but maybe that's the problem as it's also far less entertaining and interesting. I'm not a fan of the original but I will concede it had a certain something about it, this on the other hand doesn't. One to avoid I'm afraid.",unsup

I've just finished watching the second movie for the first time, it's really good! In my opinion it really improves on the original and beats Frankenhooker in entertainment value although some of the ideas in Frankenhooker were possibly more interesting. It leads on directly from the original movie and yes it does look like a studio made film rather than the location shot original but that doesn't matter, what matters is the plot is not as simple as the original which really just told how they came into being and then they went around killing a few doctors. This has more humour it's more creepy in places the special effects are better. In fact it is all just better than the original, except of cause it doesn't have the rough edge of the ultra-low budget original but this is replaced with a much more enjoyable to watch film. I wasn't expecting much from this but what I got was a very good hour and a half's entertainment which was even sicker than the original! The 'baby' part was surprising! Ignore the other comments trust me, if you like Henenlotter's other movies and Bryan Yuzna's Society you're pretty likely to gain plenty of entertainment from this. I think the original had more emotion but this has more action, take your pick. I give it 8/10!",unsup
10593_0,"Henenlotter's long-awaited (no, really!) follow-up to the 1982 classic BASKET CASE received mixed reactions among horror/gore fanatics everywhere. Many people hated this movie, because they felt the big budget and intentional laughs ruined the campy spirit of the original. Others loved BASKET CASE 2, because they just couldn't get enough of that cute little monstrosity Belial Bradley. I happen to be of the latter category.<br /><br />BC2 picks up right where the original left off: hanging from the sign of the Hotel Broslin. The twins survive the fall and are hospitalized, and their existence becomes the most hyped-up story in the media. Seeking refuge from the cruel outside world, our heroes end up becoming the newest addition to Granny Ruth's house of ""unique individuals"", a place where they are kept safely sheltered and their whereabouts remain a secret to the public. Oh yeah, the house is also chock full of dozens of friendly freaks, including a female version of Belial named Eve.<br /><br />This entry certainly has a much different feel than the original BASKET CASE, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The story is clever and stays true to the Bradley history as explained in the first movie. The special effects and make-up are simply fantastic--Belial looks more sinister than ever! Also, added to the parade of freakish monsters and gory murders is a delicately interwoven, good-natured sense of humor that somehow fits well with the rest of the film. Kudos to Frank Henenlotter, and kudos to the rest of the cast and crew, who all did an outstanding job.",unsup
10594_0,"As far as sequels are concerned, this tongue-in-cheek horror/comedy from the original film's director Frank Henenlotter is pretty good. The film picks up right where the original leaves off, has a few characters from the original returning, and just like ""Halloween 2"" it resumes inside the hospital right after the events of the original film take place. The only problem is that, since so many years have passed since the original, the actors have obviously aged quite a bit so the idea that this is the actually occurring the very same night is a bit over the top but since the film is a comedy it really does not matter. Duane Bradley and his brother Belail are 'rescued' during an attempt to escape from the hospital by Granny Ruth and her grand daughter Susan. They then take refuge in Granny Ruth's house of 'freaks'. This is when things really begin to get strange. The make-up effects are really good and there is just the right amount of humor and horror combined in the design of the 'freaks' that it makes for a highly entertaining flick. Each resident takes on their own personality and even though they later turn murderous the viewer finds themselves not only sympathizing with Duane, his brother and the rest of the freaks, but you will actually find yourself rooting them on as they seek revenge against several reporters from a sleazy tabloid who threaten to expose the Bradleys as well as a sleazy old man who runs a 'freak show' and falsely claims to have captured Belail. The make-up effects and the murder sequences are quite bizarre but highly amusing. All in all this is an above average sequel that just seems to get stranger and stranger as it progresses but will have you both terrified and laughing uproariously.",unsup
10595_0,If you loved the first film and thought it was a great movie with the exception of the low budget and occasionally bad acting then you might not like this film very much. I want to start off by saying Belial looks terrible in this movie. Did they think it would be a good idea to change what he looks like completely?! In the last film (despite the low budget effects) Belial looked good in a cheesy way. Switching off of that subject I would like to say that this film did have a higher budget and it was good that Kevin Van Hentenryck returned to play as Duane in this movie and that the budget was a lot higher in this film and the production value is noticeably better. Another thing is the continuity with the previous film is just bad. If you saw the first film first you would see that Belial tried to kill Duane because of jealousy but in this film they just brush it off like nothing happened and they tried to say it was an accident. I also didn't like the story about a house of freaks that was going overboard with the whole freak thing It was nice but these other freaks were just ridiculous. How Can a human be born with a frog head?! Overall this film isn't a good sequel but it isn't that bad.,unsup
10596_0,"Can't say I really condone Frank Hennenlotter's augmenting of the ""Basket Case"" concept, but the comedic advancement is prevalent in much of the director's film's around the early 90s and are all definitely worthy of acclaim. The original ""Basket Case"" is one of my top favorite 80s cult films ever - just a bizarre idea that is strengthened by a great grimy New York city look and ""feel"", as well as awesome gore - and ""part 2"", though it was made about 8 years after it's predecessor, picks up right after the ""dramatic"" plummet from the Hotel Broslin. Duane and Belial survive their ordeal and are sent to the hospital where they soon slip out undetected and seek refuge from the media in a half-way house for extraordinarily deformed people... Or ""freaks"", if you will. There, Belial finds a female with the same bodily structure as him and falls in love while Duane plans on finally heading out on his own. The problem is, a lone reporter is on their trail and desperate to leak the whereabouts of the much sought-after killers. The brothers and their freak brethren are then forced to defend their house from the nosy intruders... If you like Hennenlotter's films, like ""Frankenhooker"" and ""Brain Damage"", you will probably get a kick out of this. It's not nearly as dank and sadistically toned as the first one - actually, it has a more of a ""sitcom"" kind of atmosphere going on with the obvious sound stages and slight melodramatic touches - but there's some pretty crazy effects. The freaks are truly over-the-top - one having a giraffe-like neck, another with a crescent shaped head, a face full of noses, and there's even one that is just a giant mouth. Chances are, though, if you were not into the original ""Basket Case"" you surely won't like this sequel and you're probably not a Frank Hennenlotter fan in general... Overall, ""Basket Case 2"" isn't great, but it's a very silly and entertaining ""cash in"" of the indie- cult favorite from 1982.

10597_0,"Everyone's favourite surgically-separated Siamese-twins, Duane (Kevin Van Hentenryck) and Belial, return for more freakish fun in Basket Case 2, in which the brothers escape from hospital (after their near fatal fall in the first film) and find sanctuary at the home of 'Granny Ruth' (Annie Ross), who runs a haven for the physically deformed. Meanwhile, a reporter working for the gutter press is hoping for a major scoop by tracking down the brothers' whereabouts...<br /><br />Frank Henenlotter's sequel to his demented debut Basket Case once again displays a very unique vision and some incredibly dark humour, but made on a bigger budget, and away from the the original's 42nd Street locale, it lacks the trashiness, sleaziness and general grubbiness that gave the original film much of its charm.<br /><br />Also serving to weaken the film somewhat is the collection of grotesque freaks that reside at Granny Ruth's place, who include a buck-toothed, floppy eared creature, a frog-headed man, a living gargoyle, and one monstrosity with teeth as big as planks; these creations are inventive, but way too silly looking and childish in their mannerisms to be unsettling.<br /><br />Fortunately the positives outweigh the negatives: the cast pitch their performances perfectly, imbuing the film with just the right level of deranged lunacy; there are some inspired touches of twisted humour (gotta love the disabled badge on Granny Ruth's van and Belial's hilarious sex scene); and Henenlotter manages to deliver quite a few effectively macabre moments, my favourite bits being a meeting between Duane and a reporter in an Irish bar that doesn't go as planned for the newsman, a photographer's unexpected encounter with the freaks in Granny Ruth's attic, Duane coming face-to-face with a 'baby' that refuses to be born, and a suitably disturbing finale that sees the psychotic siblings joined together once again.",unsup
10598_0,"First, let me point out that I don't hate this movie. It's not bad. No, really. I mean, for what it is, Basket Case 2 ain't bad. That said, I really, really wish that this movie didn't exist. That pretty much sums up how I feel about the first sequel to Basket Case. I just can't understand how anyone who claims to be a huge fan of the original, could approve of this. And that's what I am; a HUGE fan of Basket Case. I saw that movie, as a kid, on USA Saturday Nightmares. An experience that would trigger an obsession for (almost) all that is B-cinema. I've already reviewed the original; now, I guess I should say something about this unfortunate, unnecessary sequel. This won't be easy...<br /><br />Alright, so, Henenlotter is playing the ""freaks"" card for everything it's worth . Whatever. Somehow, Duane and Belial has survived. A friend of their dead aunt, Granny Ruth, rescue the bickering brothers from the hospital, and takes them back to her place, a sanctuary for... you guessed it, freaks!! Whatever. Like I said before, not a bad movie, at all. Just nowhere near good enough to be associated with greatness. Anyway, back to Duane and Belial. So, anyway, the brothers are stuck in a house with over a dozen irritating freaks. Seriously, these guys are a whole lot more messed up than Belial. Hell, even more than Duane. Duane wants to ditch these guys, and take Ruth's granddaughter with him, and Belial is cool with hanging out there, especially since he, too has found someone. When a tabloid reporter tries to expose the freak house, Duane, being the swell guy that he is, sticks around to help his new friends defend their turf. Whatever.<br /><br />What I really hate about Basket Case 2 is that it's like a real movie. It's completely devoid of that grainy, sleazy, inept charm that the original just kinda ended up with. A quality that was pretty much non-existent by 1990. Come to think of it, nowadays would be a more appropriate time for a Basket Case sequel, with all the decent, modern Exploitation to come out of the last decade (Gutterballs). But, once again, if I had my way, there would never be a sequel. Much less, a part 3, where the gang take it down to Georgia, and whatnot. I never said don't buy Basket Case 2. Definitely support Henenlotter, simply because the guy is awesome. But if you just recently saw the original, and you got the Henenlotter fever, the next logical step would be to check out Brain Damage. Now, that you're hooked, now would be a good time to try out the sequel that never was. With hard feelings and resentment aside, I do have one last positive thing to say about Basket Case 2. No spoilers, but just so you know, the ending makes it all worth it... Almost. 7/10",unsup
10599_0,"If you have seen the first movie you'll probably be wondering how can another Basket Case movie be a continuation of the first! Well, it's easy enough, but I don't want to ruin your ""surprise""!! Anyway it begins just from where the first end. Soon, just a matter of few minutes, you are introduced in a new character that will also link this one to its sequel: that's Granny Ruth, one of the most entertaining in the whole series! This little, mid-aged lady together with an girl help Duane and Belial to escape and shelter from the police, chasing them for the first movie's massacre! Soon you discover that they're not alone in Ruth's house: not only the girl helping Granny Ruth is there, but an entire freaks community! Seems like Duane and Belial found a family, but soon troubles arrive as a journalist discover the Bradley twins shelter! It's time for massacre again!<br /><br />To be honest I found this one really entertaining, much more then the first one that was more like an""original"" slasher movie! This time Gabe Bartalos give ""tru life"" to Belial, using an animatronic model instead of a still one animated in stop motion! It really looks great! Also the other freaks look really good, and there are really a lot! A social critic find place in this movie too: as Henenlotter did in all his movies, any ""strange thing"" you see here sounds like a metaphor of true life. So the freaks community been chased just for their ""differences"" from the mass seems to be a more intense and ""intellectual"" reading key for this movie, much more than you could have been thinking.<br /><br />Crazy and really good special effects, technically much better than the average low budget movie, funny plot: it's got much more than you could expect from a movie of this kind!<br /><br />I can't say if I prefer this one ore the next one, but sure this two are very different from the first Basket Case: here you will find true comedy painted in a gory way, but no suspense or thrills!",unsup

10602_0,"The first ""Basket Case"" movie looked like it was made on a shoe-string budget. It also featured some horrible acting and directing. But director Frank Henenlotter obviously had learned since and gained more experience. The movie is more consistent this time, also in its pace.<br /><br />There was obviously some more money to spend this time, compared to the first movie. The movie is overall more professional looking and so is the Belial character. There is more movement and detail in the guy. It's professionalism also makes this an overall more effective genre movie.<br /><br />Luckily the movie obviously also doesn't take itself very serious, which in the end also is this movie its strongest point. It knows it's ridicules and it actually exploits this by putting in more ridicules new looking characters and silly moments and dialog and the actors also seem to be totally aware of this. It's also a reason why this movie is a totally pleasant genre movie to watch. It knows it's a B- and cult-movie and it doesn't resists against it. Not in the least of course due to the later success and cult following the first movie received.<br /><br />Kevin Van Hentenryck is still as horrible as ever before in his acting but they cleverly resolved this by putting in way more characters this time, so the entire focus of the movie this time isn't just upon Duane and Belial. It also lets Duane act more as a psycho this time, which also allows Van Hentenryck to do his bad overacting and make him get away with it.<br /><br />The story is of course silly but it also still is a notch up when compared to the first movie. It's at least more layered, also of course due to the fact that there are more characters in it this time. But no, overall you can't really call the movie anything more than just plain silly. Fun but silly.<br /><br />Supriningly much better than the first movie, due to the fact it was made with more money and people involved and because the movie luckily doesn't take itself serious at all. It makes sure that you as a viewer also just can't take it serious at all and therefor lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride!<br /><br />7/10",unsup

Perhaps the bit bigger budget and better makeup effects are an asset there.<br /><br />To the poster that claimed this is a ""trainwreck"" movie. I disagree. If you truly knew your b-movie history, you'd know that Hennenlotter NEVER takes his movies seriously. There is always a little nudge and a wink to his movies. They are equal parts cheese, dark humor and monster movie. they are played more for chuckles and giggles than scares.<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILERS: This is a fun little movie about Belial and Dwayne (who didn't really die in the first one, rather ended up in the hospital) finding their way to a house of freaks, where they fit in. Eventually Dwayne starts to feel left out and wants to be ""normal"". He falls in love, as does Belial.<br /><br />Along the way they get entangled with a tabloid reporter who wants to expose this house of freaks. They also run across a huckster sideshow scammer who's trying to capitalize on a fake freak show (he claims to have the bones of Belial) and of course gets a visit from the freaks.<br /><br />The babies at the end is a great twist as are a few of the other twists (especially Dwayne's girlfriend revealing why she isn't ""normal"".<br /><br />Another cheese classic from Hennenlotter. Rent this along with the original ""Basket Case"", ""Frankenhooker"" and ""Brain Dead"" (Not the Peter Jackson movies that is a/k/a ""Dead Alive"") and enjoy a Hennenlotter triple bill.

And the dialogues are pedant, in situations like the related ones no one can't talk like that.

Also acting and cut are bad - especially the scene where the gay finds the women drowned in the pool. I thought ""what the hell was that""?

When summoned to the boy's bedside, Martin believes his son has tried to commit suicide, although the facts are unclear. What is apparent, however, is that the director (Frederico Luppi), known only as Martin, has distanced himself from his family, hiding his emotions to those who looked to him for support: his son, his mistress Alicia (Cecilia Roth), and his gay actor friend Dante (Eusebio Poncela). Potentially melodramatic, Argentinean director Adolfo Aristarain's (A Place in the World) Martin (Hache), handles the material with skill and intelligence and, while the dialogue often sounds like tedious psychodrama, impeccable performances by Luppi and Roth make Martin extremely watchable.<br /><br />Juan Diego Botto is Martin's son, known as Hache (Junior) or Jay in the English subtitles. Though quite intelligent, Jay does not work or go to school and his only interest seems to be playing the guitar. Feeling unwanted by both parents, rejected by his girlfriend, and thinking that he has let his father down by underachieving, he resorts to a potentially lethal combination of drugs and booze that almost end his young life. Martin is persuaded by his ex-wife to take Jay back to Madrid though he is leery of having to once again assume the responsibilities of fatherhood.<br /><br />Taking on a new project, he soon leaves for the south of Spain to find film locations, leaving Jay with Dante and his girlfriend Alicia, both heavy drug users.

However, I agree it might be difficult for other Spanish speaking people who are used to a more 'orthodox' Spanish to understand parts of the dialogs, which is a shame. Dialogues are what makes this film so interesting and touching. The things that are said contrast with the things that remained unsaid, and you can only imagine by reading the character's eyes. Alicia, for example, is almost always laughing and having fun, but her eyes are dark, worried. Her happiness is just a mask she wears to avoid realize how much she feels bad about what she is missing for, a real family, with children. She only tells Hache about that, she wishes she were his mother. Hache apparently is resigned to being a nuisance for his parents, but he wants to escape this situation by living alone, even though he's not ready yet. He uses drugs and only his father's best friend manages to keep him away from danger.<br /><br />The two main actors were great. Federico Luppi's portrayal of a father who is very disappointed for his son's way of life was so real I wanted to kick him! Juan Diego Botto was perfect, too.

Cecilia Roth (whom half the Spanish talking world has been in love with), and one of the five best actors of all times, FEDERICO LUPPI.<br /><br />It's impossible not to think about my own father seeing his personage, with this overwhelming love for his son and yet unable to communicate with. Maybe I've seen it over five times, and still I cry each time when Federico Luppi stands on the balcony talking about the desperation of life after the idea of loosing his son misunderstood. It's the nearest you will get to understand fatherly love if you don't yet have a baby.<br /><br />The plot is banal, and the filming nothing complicated, just a camera fixed to let all the attention to actors........but then, the hit. What an acting!!!!!. You hardly are going to see something similar, Luppi is a monster, a giant, he fills the screen with a strength rarely seen away.<br /><br />A must see in Spanish, where you can really judge their beautiful work.

10624_0,"At times I felt this film might have been adapted from stage-theatre, so good are the dialogues; scintillating, the right way to speak Spanish  if you will excuse the `porteño' accent so very necessary for the film. The old `maestro' Federico Luppi is about as good as in any other film I have seen him in, I suppose; Juan Diego de Botto is better than in other films of his that I have seen; but the real standing ovation is for Eusebio Ponce who plays very delicately and intelligently the philosophical homosexual, and Cecilia Roth is outstanding as the film-director's girl-friend. Though I must say that I am beginning to get accustomed to Cecilia Roth being outstanding in everything she does.<br /><br />The direction is right  spot on; tight, befitting the excellent playing out of the dialogues and demanding great skill with the camera and later the person with the scissors. Adolfo Arastarain worked hard for this one: the result is a hugely satisfying piece.<br /><br />Once again, as erstwhile said elsewhere in IMDb, for those who like real character-driven pieces with intelligent dialogues, this film is highly recommendable. However, for those of you with a fair knowledge of Spanish, if you are not used to the Argentinian (porteño) accent you may well have problems, such that you will need the subtitles. It is worth the effort, I can assure you: just over 8 out of 10, which is pretty high on my scale.",unsup
10625_0,"Adolfo Aristarain is one of those rare filmmakers who defines his own world in cinema by writing and directing terrific stories with brilliant dialogue and using a familiar cadre of actors who give the finished product an ensemble effort. He is one of Argentina's finest artists and couples frequently with writer Kathy Saavedra (Roma, Un lugar en el mundo, Lugares communes, Martín (Hache), etc) and elects to use the extraordinary actors from Argentina such as Federico Luppi. Cecilia Roth, Juan Diego Botta and Eusebio Poncela. The results are stunning motion pictures that while addressing the intellect of the audience never fail to entertain as well.<br /><br />'Martín (Hache)' is just such a film. With a challenging and wise script and a cadre of fine actors in every role Aristarain has created a poignant, philosophical and superlative character study about people and their need for relating in the world as we have altered it today. Martín (the brilliant Federico Luppi) is a wealthy writer who left his family in Buenos Aires five years ago to live and work in Madrid. He has a nineteen year old son Hache (Juan Diego Botta) - Hache is the Spanish pronunciation for the alphabet letter 'J' and since the son's name is Martin J. he elects to be called J or Hache - who is a restless, foundationless teenager who refuses to go to school preferring to simply play his electric guitar and run with the drug crowd. His mother has remarried and has a new baby and Hache is feeling like a third wheel. He accidentally overdoses on alcohol and drugs during a performance, collapses, and his mother notifies Martín that Hache has attempted suicide to induce Martín to return to Buenos Aires and take back his son Hache. Hache of course recovers and his mother insists that Hache is in the way and that he must go to Madrid to live with Martín: Martín begrudgingly agrees.<br /><br />In Madrid, Martín has been living the life of a recluse whose only contacts are his squeeze Alicia (Cecilia Roth, an actress of limitless talent), who escapes her life by an addiction to coke but loves Martín, and his best friend the bisexual actor Dante (Eusebio Poncela) who is an Epicurean living all aspects of life for the pleasures he finds. Once Hache has moved in with his distant, cold, sullen father he falls under the influence of Alicia and Dante who adore him and attempt to show him a life of sunshine in Madrid while Martín sequesters himself in his writing. How this unlikely quartet interacts, bouncing the Apollonian against the Dionysian poles of living forms the basis for the story. Hache grows to understand the spectrum of worldviews, a tragedy occurs, and the ongoing silent duel between the father and the son comes to a touching resolution.<br /><br />Hearing and watching this quartet of brilliant actors is not unlike attending a performance of a fine string quartet. Aristarain keeps the long film (two hours +) moving in such a beautifully liquid flow that the story seems to take moments. But the moments are all treasures, the result of the ensemble of writing, directing, and acting. 'Martín (Hache)' is simply a brilliant film. In Spanish with English subtitles. Grady Harp",unsup
10626_0,"Once or twice in a lifetime you watch a movie that strikes you exactly in the moment when you need it, and you feel completely identified with it. That happened to me today when I saw Martín (Hache), commenting on movies is a very subjective thing to do, you can like a movie even if it's a flick just because you needed someone to tell you what the movie is saying in that exact moment. Anyway, that's what this movie is about; reflection and not only for young people also for adults.<br /><br />This movie has lots of social and political opinions in between lines, it's a perfect mirror of the society we live in but it doesn't give a point of view that's what's great about it!, it keeps itself objective. Like Dante would say about drugs, they make everything relative the only truth is your truth, Post-modernism!, XX Century!, there aren't any more rules to obey, society is rotten and it's a dream to try and change it, so you might as well adapt and enjoy the ""good"" things about life.<br /><br />After you see this movie I really hope you question yourself, what is the meaning of ""good"".

The film is also noteworthy for its portrayal of the hypocrisy of adults who impose upon their children ""values"" that they themselves reject in their day-to-day lives. The gay character is refreshingly unapologetic. And the female lead is heartbreakingly real, a brilliant and deeply moving performance by Cecilia Roth.

The role of young Martín (Hache), perfect and tender Juan Diego Botto, as the real survivor of the script, turning sour into sweetness, and insecurity into strenght, even though he's lost in hesitations, is a message of faith in life.<br /><br />The dialogs are intelligent and sharp, the actors, gorgeous. And I fell in love with Martín (Hache) for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Thank you, Adolfo Aristarain for such a great, sensitive, risky and intelligent movie and thank you, Federico Lupi, Cecilia Roth, Eusebio Poncela and, specially, Juan Diego Botto for your incredible work.",unsup
10629_0,"This is one of those movies that is just simply enjoyable to watch. I chuckled much of the way through it. I laughed out loud at the antics of Botts when trying to get away from the practicing of our hero. But I precede myself. The hero played by David Niven, who I am an admitted fan of, is a high strung, nervous, major up tight concert pianist and very famous. He is being run by his manager, who in turn runs the butler and every one else who supposedly takes care of David Niven. One day a funny little man comes to see Mr. Niven. The former owner of The Cleopatra Arms, an apartment building played by Victor Moore who is absolutely adorable in the part. Moore takes David Niven to see the building he owns and introduces him to the tenants there. One of the tenants is a model named Polly played by Jane Wyman. As a rule I am not a big fan of Miss Wymans, but in this movie she is quite fetching. Mr. Niven takes one look at her in shorts, is immediately smitten with her and his life begins to change. I do not remember seeing David Niven and Jane Wyman in any other movie together, but in this one they make a very appealing couple. The funniest scene takes place when Jane Wyman, Victor Moore and David Niven are striving to drive the one bad tenant, Potts, out of the Cleopatra Arms by having Niven come and do his 6-8 hour piano practicing in the room next to Potts who works nights and makes everyones life miserable by yelling at them to keep quiet so he can sleep days. Broderick Crawford plays Botts. Crawford usually played such serious roles and rarely had a chance to show his comic flair, but in this movie he gets his chance and he does a very good job. All in all I think this is a very charming movie. I really enjoyed it.",unsup

Who's to not be trusted?<br /><br />The movie is like the 50's and 60's but with aliens attaching themselves to your back instead of some sneaky russian.<br /><br />There are so many elements that are borrowed from other borrower-movies (pun intended) that this becomes a very mediocre mess. The cheesy way of noticing non-humans was the first thing that made me roll my eyes. Also funny how the puppets are quite human in the beginning of the movie and then towards the end are really robotic.<br /><br />Well, not to give too much away, but this is really lowbudget action-scifi.

When an apartment manager visits him, Niven learns that one of his investments is The Cleopatra Apartments. One look at Jane Wyman in her shorts and Niven decides not to be an absentee landlord.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining comedy, and I agree with previous posters that there are laugh out loud scenes. Some of the comedy is provided by, of all people, Broderick Crawford as a subletter who works at night and sleeps -- or tries to -- all day. It's a different role for Crawford, and he does it very well.<br /><br />Wyman is very pretty and vivacious as an apartment dweller who falls for Niven, and the two have wonderful chemistry.

Niven, as the pampered pianist, and Wyman, as a down-to-earth print model, are likable as always (and Wyman displays fantastic legs wearing white shorts in one scene where Niven literally can't take his eyes off her) but they can only do so much with the middling material.

10634_0,"""Payment on Demand"" begins when David tells Joyce that he wants a divorce. In flashbacks we see how the couple came from humble beginnings and worked their way into affluence. David started from being a lawyer with no clients and worked his way up to being vice president of his best client, a steel company. Joyce was always preoccupied with security, money and status; she is a selfish, manipulative social climber and we can readily see why David wants out. As always, Bette Davis plays the bitch with consummate skill.<br /><br />What follows shows the old-style divorce process at its worst and chronicles Joyce's life as a single woman. While this part is very well written, it is dated. We learn that an older single woman has no life (other than having to pay younger men to sleep with them) and you're always better off with a man.<br /><br />While the themes of this film may seem pretty conventional by today's standards, they were anything but in 1951. Divorce was a subject literally ruled off the screen by the very Catholic-oriented Hays Code. Aside from frothy romantic comedies like ""The Awful Truth,"" people just didn't get divorced because they were fed up with their spouses. Nor do films of that Hays era (from 1934 until 1968) ever delve into the actual process of contested divorce (such as the negotiations about property settlements). This film does all that.

Everyone claiming that the Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now are brilliant, yet everything else is ""An example of an egomaniac not having objectivity."" I've read a lot of reviews and this is all that I've read as the complaints for his later stuff. Sure the negative reviews focus on how thin the characters are thin, and the plot covers a short span of time. But honestly it's a Fairy Tale, and fairy tales have simple plots and thin characters. These same people would praise films like the Princes Bride, or Beauty & the Beast, but not One From the Heart. And why?<br /><br />Because One From the heart has amazing music, from Tom Waits that almost makes it worth seeing just for that. The movie is a musical, which is gutsy for anyone to write a new musical, but the lighting technical achievement is incredible. The film has what I would call ""Color Scenes,"" where each scene is lighted heavily with certain colors, which play into the emotion of the scene. <br /><br />The film is an amazing achievement, for the visuals and the music, which is what it sought after to achieve. Ignore the negative reviews about what a disappointment it is, because the people who write those reviews don't have their own opinion, it's nothing but people repeating the Coppola myth of losing his touch. All he lost was the studio support. And because he focuses on perfecting his art and not making millions of dollars. <br /><br />Great Film, go see it, if you like good movies and don't get doped by the fake critics who talk from a lens that says ""this movie is suppose to be bad.""",unsup

Maybe audiences expected much more from Francis Ford Coppola, something deeper and more complicated. What we got is a sweet and touching romance about a couple who break up and make up. <br /><br />The leads were a little shaky in the beginning but got warmer as the film went along. I wound up liking them. I thought the second leads were good too. It was nice to see Teri Garr in a sexy part, showing off her body and dance steps. Also, it was cool to see one of Nastssja Kinskis early roles. Maybe because the film bombed the two actresses never became really big in American movies. This film did not have a chance after Coppolas ""Apocalyse Now"". <br /><br />Give this bright and colourful film a chance. Great photography with nice tunes by Tom Waits!",unsup

One From the Heart was made following his Boy Gang trilogy, which has also confused many as to ""why?"" the creator of the Godfather saga would go so far afield.<br /><br />Creative masters simply are different. Sometimes their egos and force of will create incredible works of art which also manage to achieve commercial success and mass appeal. Often times their works succeed as art, but fail at the box office.<br /><br />One From the Heart is homage to the lavish musicals of the 30's, and an expression of Coppola's love of Theater. The sets and effects are beautiful on a large screen. The craft and technical skill is apparent in each shot and throughout the film. Terri Garr and Frederic Forrest are the ""everyman"" antithesis of Astaire and Rogers. The mix of simplicity and grandeur is not for everyone.<br /><br />I loved the movie. I also understand why most do not. Viewers go to a lavish musical to escape and be entertained. Coppola wants one to view the movie and appreciate his vision and his life, and perhaps experience some of his romantic notions of times gone by. Most people do not want to spend money and opportunity for such notions.",unsup
10639_0,"A huge roll of the dice that wiped out Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope studio and saw him spending the next decade churning out pictures to pay off the debts the $28m flop left him with, One From the Heart is one of those films I really want to like  to love, even  but which just won't let me. Visually it's a triumph, but the Tom Waits suicide blues score rarely works as a screen musical and as a human drama its kept firmly on the ground by the fact these characters just aren't likable. Coppola seems more interested in his lavish studio settings than what's happening in them, with even the most mundane sequences shot like an imaginatively staged theatrical musical with intricate shifts of lighting and colour, dissolving walls and neon dreams. But perhaps the biggest problem of all is that Coppola doesn't seem to have made this film for the audience but for himself, and so it probably never connects with anyone not on his personal wavelength. The trailers give away a big part of the problem: the 1982 release stresses the Godfather and Apocalypse Now as evidence of Coppola's genius while the 2003 reissue trailer runs off a list of critical superlatives in a sternly unemotional voice: joy isn't on the menu here.<br /><br />That the story is so simple as to be almost invisible  a couple split up over the 4th July weekend and become involved with new partners  needn't be a problem: after all, three sailors on furlough looking for Miss Turnstiles or a backwoodsman convincing his six bachelors to kidnap six local girls to marry aren't exactly complex. With good casting, good writing and good musical numbers, there's no real reason it shouldn't work. Unfortunately it doesn't get them. The argument that kicks off the split is atrociously written and just as badly acted  you've seen more vicious spats on The Dick Van Dyke Show  and because we never buy it for a moment the film is handicapped almost from the start. The fact that either lead can carry a movie, is even more of a problem, leaving you with a film without any heart at its centre: Raul Julia is the only member of the cast who really shines, and he probably has the least screen time of anyone in the picture. The constant crosscutting doesn't help, with Coppola cutting away as soon as one scene starts to gel to focus on an awkward one that never does. Despite input from Gene Kelly (barely noticeable) and Michael Powell (visually very noticeable), it's not even quite a musical  aside from a couple of fantasy numbers it opts Yentl-like to keep the singing as an invisible chorus/underscore not so much commenting as setting the melancholy tone that counterpoints the bright, garish visuals. The film's one promising musical number, where Julia's serenade of Teri Garr spills out onto the streets of Las Vegas, is never allowed to play uninterrupted without meandering shots of Frederic Forrest wandering through the neon streets.<br /><br />Coppola's 2003 re-edit of the film does nothing to improve matters. The revised opening is a little smoother but at the expense of Forrest's character, removing all remaining traces of colour to make him even more of a boring homebody. It's an excellent DVD, however, with everything you could want to know and more and offering some fairly frank insights into the failure of Coppola's attempt to ally the expertise of the old studio contract system with the modern advances of electronic cinema, not to mention the constant financing problems. It's just a shame that the film itself is so damn hard to love.",unsup

What is exceptional about the film is the cinematography, the spectacular lighting, seamless no transition scenes without cuts, the integral sound track by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle, and a stunning Nastassia Kinski in an over-sized martini glass. With the use of such vivid color by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, it is highly reminiscent of Fassbinder's 1981 'Lola' in which green and blue lighting come off skin and works quite well. Recently released on a spectacular two DVD set that was remastered by Coppola, the high quality transfer, supervised by Storaro, from Zoetrope via Fantoma works quite well on the normal sized TV screen and looks even better than it did in its short time release around the country in late 2003 and January 2004. 'One from the heart' is an unusual romantic musical with dance sequences supervised by Gene Kelly, with the only singing done by a cast member is Nastassia's 'Little Boy Blue.' The DVD is exceptionally visual with running film commentary by Coppola plus many other bonus features.",unsup
10648_0,"ONE FROM THE HEART (4 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Don't read too much into the 4 star rating I give this movie. It is NOT an easy movie to like... there is so much wrong with it (bland, dislikable lead characters, poor dialogue, over-stylized sets) but it means well... and there are also a lot of things that DO work (Tom Waits' music, the young and sexy Raul Julia and Nastassia Kinski, the airport scene). Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr play the two long-time partners... both kind of bored with the other and wishing for something new and exciting in their lives. Over the course of a day they break up, meet a fascinating new person, have a one-night-stand and then come to realize what they want most in life. Not much of a plot, is it? How much you like this movie will be pretty much determined by how much you like Tom Waits' music... which is heard throughout. He and Crystal Gayle sing slow, romantic ballads which give the movie the feel of a longggggggggg music video. (One the new DVD edition you can watch the movie listening to a ""music only"" track... and, honestly, it's probably better that way.) Forrest and Garr are kind of hard to accept as romantic leads... they both seem a little too bland and ordinary (which was the director's intention)... but also come across as too unlikable: Garr is a whiny shrew and Forrest is a macho jerk. Again, it was the director's intention that they be ""real people"" so he wanted to portray them with warts and all. Unfortunately he didn't seem to give audiences enough reason to *like* these people. If Raul Julia and Nastassia Kinski had been the main characters the movie may have been more successful. I think that main problem with this movie is that director Francis Ford Coppola put too much *thought* into what is supposed to be a movie heavy on *emotion*. It does seem a little cold and distancing at times... technically perfect... but not fully satisfying as a story. Still, I've seen it about ten times... and I don't think think Coppola has made a better movie *since*.",unsup

Coppola takes a cheesy genre, accentuates the fake and unreal and uses the most ordinary ""real"" actors he can find.<br /><br />This combination of pure fantasy and recognisable characters drives the story. This pretty boring almost middle-aged couple re offered a last shot of romance and glamour - and dive into it headlong. Tom Waits' incredible songs add a brilliant running commentary. <br /><br />And then there is the visual side, a smorgasbord of lush effects and glaring colors. Like so many movies, ""One From the Heart"" runs best on a movie screen, rather than a TV. The trailers I've seen don't do justice to this oddball combination of corn and touching emotion. <br /><br />So you'll just have to see it and make up your own mind.",unsup

""The Puppet Maser"" has at times an awfully TV-movie looking visual style and the characters and story are mostly wasted.

The story is very good and also original. The execution of it is just plain bad at times. All of the characters are wasted and the movie is filled with some plot holes and illogical moments. Seriously, I'm convinced of it that with a different director at the helm, this movie really could and would had grown in to be a classic science-fiction masterpiece.<br /><br />However as entertainment this movie is good enough. Science-fiction fans will certainly enjoy this movie which is mainly due to the original alien invasion story and the above average special effects.<br /><br />Don't expect great things from the cast though. The dialog and acting is at times B-movie like. Eric Thal is a failed movie-hero and Donald Sutherland is wasted. Also Will Patton and especially Yaphet Kotto are criminally underused.<br /><br />The movie is certainly watchable but to most this movie will probably seem like a silly science-fiction movie.

10650_0,"This is one of those rare movies where the cinematography (by the incomparable Vittorio Storaro) and the music (by the equally incomparable Tom Waits, probably his most beautiful bunch of songs and instrumentals ever recorded) warranted (and for the latter received) some Oscar nominations, while the script warranted a golden raspberry. Coppola decided to take a risk and experiment even further after Apocalypse Now- to go to something 'light' like musicals he directed in college after going through such a dark experience like A.N.- and in the process made something that, had it paradoxically been a silent film with most of the accompanying music, would've been a full-blown masterpiece. To say it's gorgeous to look at isn't suffice; anyone who has any interest in the abstract qualities that film can offer, the sublime levels of a ""movie"" in all its plastic qualities of lavish and stylized production design, ideas put into the construction of a world of fantasy with music, and bright primary colors and compositions that look like they're out of a dream, would have to make it a must-see.<br /><br />If it's necessarily a good movie is another matter. The problem is, as mentioned, when the characters have to read the lines, which have only so much development as a stunted fetus. Despite all the efforts put in by the unconventional leading players Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr, plus Raul Julia, Natassia Kinski, and Harry Dean Stanton in some clever and juicy supporting roles, and even a couple of moments of real, genuine heart and heartbreak (the latter being of note when Forrest tries to sing ""You are my sunshine""), t's just too thin a story to nearly justify all the effort put into it. It makes it almost a frustrating experience to see it all unfold, as the little moments that the characters do connect are overshadowed by the moments of surrealism that Coppola can't pull off. Unlike Apocalypse Now where Coppola managed to equate the complex nature of the characters with he tremendous vision, here he can only do the latter.<br /><br />That being said, I wish it could've done a better at the box-office, if only had it been released as an art-house film, or (dare I say it) hadn't been so overblown with the finances in it, as it was the film that first put Coppola into chapter 11. However, anytime I want to hear the saddest songs of love recorded in the 80s I can always put on the soundtrack. And it provides more than a few moments of cinematography that will remain unparalleled in the years to come even as digital film grows stronger and film grows more obsolete. Bottom line, only Coppola could roll the dice on this one and almost make it a bona-fide classic.",unsup

My wife and I have loved this film for years, having first seen it on the hard-to-find VHS tape, and later on the even harder-to-find LaserDisc. Over the years we've probably watched it more than two dozen times, and we were eagerly awaiting our chance to see it in 35mm.<br /><br />We were heartbroken. This is not a restoration - this is a desecration. The wonderful flow of the film was broken right at the begining. The stunning opening shot - through the ""Golden Nugget"" sign, down to the street, over the cars, outside the window, through the window, following Teri Garr as she talks to Lainie Kazan to a close-up of Teri looking in a mirror that cross-dissolves into Frederick Forrest looking into a mirror at his workplace and a great scene with Forrest and Stanton is chopped off right outside the window! We were jerked out of the picture, and thought there must have been a reel mixup.<br /><br />No. Apparently Coppola had taken all the criticism to heart and decided to try to please all the people who hated the film by making it more conventional. The result will please nobody. The new scenes are gracelessly edited in with painfully conventional cross-cutting between the storylines, and the lyrical dance/seduction of Teri Garr by Raul Julia is completely chopped up for no readily apparent reason.<br /><br />It's as if someone decided the mirror sequence in the Marx Brother's ""Duck Soup"" needed to be broken up by a love scene with Zeppo.<br /><br />The new scenes aren't all bad. In their defense, they make some elements of the plot clearer - the anniversary gifts in particular. And the scene in the car afterwards is interesting. But I would have prefered to have seen these scenes as DVD extras, and to have a DVD copy of the film I have on LaserDisc.<br /><br />I'm sure these scenes could have been added without restructuring the entire film.

Just saw the film again, and except for being a tad embarrassed that we wore such silly clothes back then, I think it holds up beautifully. Yes, it could have been cast differently. But the point was to drop the normal-looking, average joe and mary into a fantasy setting. IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK FAKE. The sets are gorgeous! It's based on what Vegas used to look like, before they tore it all down and put up that oversized Disneyland.

10661_0,"This film has always been a favorite. My wife and I have worn out two video versions over the years, as well as a copy of the soundtrack LP (being big Tom Waits fans also). Needless to say, we were thrilled to see it finally come out on DVD. What a joke. Somewhere along the line Coppola must have decided that it could be improved upon, and managed to destroy it in the process. From the opening scenes it's a mess. The music has even been relocated. In the original version there's very little dialog needed in the beginning because the song lyrics perfectly describe what's going on. Not any more. Not only do the lyrics no longer match what's happening on the screen, but there's even dialog on top of the lyrics in spots. Scenes were added that actually take away from the film while a few favorite spots have been cut out. One truly bad judgment call is where there was a love scene with Teri Garr and Raul Julia followed by one with Fredric Forrest and Nastassja Kinski. In the new ""improved"" version it cuts back and forth between the two scenes like the viewers attention span must not be long enough to remember what happened last. There are also some harsh scene cuts now in the film that weren't there in the original (including one extra bad one where the music is abruptly cut off). One of the most impressive things about the original release was the way the film flowed from beginning to end much like a stage play. That's gone. One thing I can't figure out is the other reviewers of this film that are watching the DVD copy after seeing it on video, yet none of them seem to notice the difference. How is that possible? If the DVD version had been the original release back in 1982, I wouldn't be writing this now. I would have only seen the film once, and would have forgotten it immediately. In spite of the unfair rap this film got in the beginning, I've always defended it as one of Coppola's best works. He gambled and lost everything on this film including his studio complex in the process. It took many years and films to pay back the debts, but the end result was a cinematic beauty that stood on it's own merits. Sadly, what's left of it can't even do that now.

For all I know, New York is what can be seen through the eyes of Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese... and Francis Ford Coppola. <br /><br />I would pretty much compare ONE FROM THE HEART to Allen's MANHATTAN, in the sense that both are new-yorkers visions of romance and beauty, filtered through a broadway theatrical and glamorous sensibility. This film, however, unlike MANHATTAN, isn't about New York. It's about spining through the spotlights of a city that parties all night long (cabarets, jazz, dance and magical flirts), only to realize that in the end, it's going to be your simple significant other waiting for you in the backstage.<br /><br />The staging of the whole movie helps a lot, in the sense that's it's all filmed in studio. Magical skies and dawns that make it easy to pass from a store-window directly to a sunset in Bora-Bora; lust and life and music in what I would consider the last great musical.

He recruited many of the industries best and brightest for the production. It was Coppola's follow up to the legendary ""Apocalypse Now."" The film was supposed to mark a new direction for filmmaking as a whole. Zoetrope was to be a place where directors and storytellers could produce their films without studio interference. The artists would control the medium, not the business men. And with ""One From the Heart"", Coppola's dream came to a thundering halt after just one movie. Though not as well known, it stands along side ""Heaven's Gate"" as a film that proved that the wonder directors of the 70's would not be given the keys to the castle. ""Heart"" was that once in a decade disaster and it's not hard to see why it was such an ignored film. It turns out that this story behind the film is far more interesting to follow than the film itself.<br /><br />""One From the Heart"" is as stylized as films can come. Shot entirely on the sets at Zoetrope, ""Heart"" attempts to tell the story of Franny and Hank, a long together couple possibly nearing the end of their rope with one another. The couple calls it quits and they seek solitude in the arms of more adventuresome lovers for one night in an entirely reproduced Las Vegas. Coppola's decision to cast Frederic Forest and Teri Garr seems daring at first, almost brave. But casting two such down to Earth actors against the overwhelming design of ""One From the Heart"" leaves the two with nothing to do but drown under the neon cinematography. Garr and Forest give it a go, but their problems seem minor against the wave of the film itself. It's possible no two actors could've asserted themselves against this backdrop. Coppola has infused every shot in ""Heart"" with enough technique and design that he seems to have completely forgotten to add any element of genuine drama into the proceedings. The story never moves far beyond the 'will they stay together or break up' arc. It isn't without possibility, but it's more suited to a smaller more intimate scale, not the phantasmagoric, neon coated reality that constantly draws attention to itself that Coppola labors to construct. All the design is admirable and on occasion very gorgeous. But it won't take an astute viewer very long to see that ""One From the Heart"" is a film more intended to be looked at than actually watched. A technological achievement in filmmaking? Yes. A genuinely involving film? No.<br /><br />Despite disliking the film I'm glad to see it's finally available on DVD in a watchable format.

The couple runs a dry cleaning business in an unexciting small French town. Their lives change when they go to a bar with some business associates and encounter Loïc and Marylin, a cross dressing brother/sister act. From the first, the couple is fascinated with the pair but particularly with Loïc, the sexually ambiguous brother, (played to perfection by Stanislas Merhar).<br /><br />The couple is so enchanted with the pair that they take a weekend to the city where the performers are appearing next. When the sister decides to end the act and run away with her lover, the brother insinuates himself into the couples lives. The young man claims to be, and is by all indications, straight and soon takes the wife as a lover. The husband is also aroused by the boy but denies his attraction. Soon the boy is living in the couple's home and working in the Dry Cleaning shop and is showing a talent for that type of work. He even befriends the couple's child and helps him with homework and takes him skating.<br /><br />Whether his good work arises from Loïc's desire to repay Jean-Marie or from some innate talent for dry cleaning is unclear. I think that Loïc feels guilty about cuckolding this man who has shown him nothing but kindness, genuinely likes the guy, and is aware of the man's attraction to him. He wants to make amends in any way that he can. Ultimately Loïc offers himself to Jean-Marie physically but is rebuffed. <br /><br />Whether it's the husband's `homosexual panic' or his actually seeing his wife with Loïc during one of their trysts, Jean-Marie decides that Loïc must go.

The film's air of calm scrutiny is generally engrossing though, as it sketches the quiet disappointments and compromises of rural small business; a life caught up by routine, where years go by without a vacation. The plot initially finds the couple fascinated by sheer difference, leaving an enjoyable ambiguity as to whether there's any real sexual attraction on Berling's part toward Merhar, or whether it's largely a matter of intertwined ego, loneliness, and a symbolic yielding to the limitations of his life (the sexual encounter here looks like a pure power play).

10669_0,"Spoilers...<br /><br />""Dry cleaning"", that's what the title of this Anne Fontaine's effort means in English and it's a well-appropriated one to qualify the contents of the story she tells the audience. Its bulk essentially occurs in a dry-cleaner whose purpose is to clean the customers' clothes but the director prefers to soil her couple's clear conscience as well as their moral, sexual conventions.<br /><br />Could this film be a crossing between Claude Chabrol's universe and Pier Paolo Pasolini's film ""Theorema"" (1968)? It's highly possible and they're respectable credentials for this novel, idiosyncratic film. The first one for the provincial backdrop and a dash of gastronomy. The author of ""le Boucher"" (1970) and ""les Noces Rouges"" (1973) excelled when it came to depict vignettes of provincial life, in the Kunstler's shop and apartment but also in the town itself. Anne Fontaine just has to describe with just a few features, the gloomy aura which reigns in Belfort. And the second reference for of course the story of the film which bears a strong resemblance with Pasolini's opus: both introduced a young man who subverted a comfortable universe and caused damage in them. ""Nettoyage à Sec"" could be an updated version of ""Theorema"".<br /><br />Loïc is the disruptive element in the Kunstler's ""petit bourgeois"" world. More than this, he's the catalyst of their buried desires and passions. Before making their dreary universe with its constricting etiquette falter in the dry-cleaner's, he will at first indirectly galvanize them to accomplish their desires. The week-end in Bâle, unusual in the couple' life is a proof of it. Before this, one of the key sequences is the one when the four protagonists are together in the hotel room because in this moment, the persona of Jean Marie and especially Nicole is well construed and defined. It's necessary to steer well the evolution and crucial steps of the story. Nicole makes love with Loïc and it's a sign that she's tired of her life and is ready to go in a new direction. Later, Fontaine will intersperse her film with conspicuous signs which don't fool anyone. See the scene in the restaurant: she confesses to her husband that she doesn't feel courageous enough to carry on her nine-to-five life in the dry-cleaner's. She's on the verge of packing in. Jean-Marie's answer is meaningful: ""however when we started, you wanted to be the first one to help me to settle here..."". So, it seems perfectly logical that later she accepts Loïc's advances. As for Jean-Marie, he appears hesitant and undetermined but maybe would he like (unconsciously or not) change his life in spite of an eloquent sequence: when he takes Loïc downstairs to show him concrete memories of his first years spent in the shop. Memories to which he is deeply attached...<br /><br />Loïc's demeanor is rather elusive and it's hard to decipher his mainspring. Is it because he lost his closest human being in the world (Marilyn) that he settles to Nicole and Jean-Marie? Is he sick of his nomad life despite what he says to the couple? By enticing the couple, does he try to fulfill an affective gap in his life? It was shrewd from Fontaine to make opaque his motivations. Thus, he keeps all his mystery. It was also clever from the director to have chosen evocative colors for her film and she's got a sense of light. The white of the dry-cleaner's sharply contrasts with the half-murky, dimly light rooms in the apartment, especially when Loïc is in these rooms. This to underscore that the life of the couple with Loïc's intrusion goes bit by bit unravel. She also has the gift to build her film on a relentless crescendo and to shroud it with an increasingly latent, ominous tension. A tension caused by several factors: disquieting moments or lines pronounced by Loïc, by the contrast between the appearance the couple gives to the customers and employees and what lies beneath this when they are in the apartment with Loïc, especially when the latter finds himself with Nicole. And it won't take long for Jean Marie to discover their love affair. But also with Jean-Marie's tantrums he has to try to resist to the strange attraction he feels for Loïc. His short wild mood swings are the result of a sexual repression he vainly wants to conceal. Loïc will feel it very well in the inevitable sequence in which he will try to sodomize him (a violent one which packs a real wallop). After this scene, one could argue that the couple came back to where they started but in worse: Nicole and Jean-Marie are destroyed.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly good and largely lives up to the demands of the scenario. The type of character of each actor of the quartet complements one another. Although the film really put Mathilde Seigner on the map, it's her coy, brazen partner Stanislas Mehrer who gets the lion's share. I don't put Charles Berling and Miou-Miou in my straitjacket of favorite French actors but here, I was very taken with their acting.<br /><br />""Nettoyage à Sec"" has a taut, well-constructed scenario in which every step of the story rings true. It's an unsettling piece of work which leaves indelible stains. It may also walk a fine line with works like ""Harry: Un Ami Qui Vous Veut Du Bien"" (2000) by Dominik Moll which could be his little brother. I would like to discover Anne Fontaine's anterior and subsequent works to her 1997 film.",unsup

10670_0,"It's impossible - for me at least - to know whether or not Ann Fontaine was familiar with Joe Orton's sixties play Entertaining Mister Sloane (subsequently filmed)before writing and directing Nettoyage a sec some thirty years later but it is reasonable to assume that the central premise - bi-sexual catalyst male enters and ultimately disrupts household via sexual encounters with both male and female - is very similar with, in the case of the latter, a Gallic twist. Orton's protagonist disrupted a home occupied by a brother and sister both childless whilst Fontaine's shares a home with a married couple who have a child. There are, of course, other substantial differences, where Mr Sloane came, as it were, out of nowhere, Loic (Stanislas Merhar) is first encountered by Nicole (Miou-Miou) and Jean-Marie (Charles Berning) Kunstler in a club where he is performing a cross-dressing act with his sister Marilyn (Mathilde Seigner)and only goes to live with the Kunstlers some time later when Marilyn leaves both him and the act in favour of life with her boy friend. The Kunstlers have been married for some fifteen years and it may be said that the marriage has become as 'dry' as the dry cleaning business they own and is in need of sexual 'cleaning'. If so they came to the right place for the amoral Loic is happy to oblige, first by seducing Nicole - not terribly difficult as she was ripe for seduction - and then, with less success, Jean-Marie. What we have here is a fine, tightly written and directed script acted to perfection by the three principals and arguably the finest of Fontaines early films - Berning would later appear in her How I Killed My Father. Very definitely worth seeing.",unsup

The music was only one reason among others that made me watch the film twice in four hours. I am a French film enthusiast and the contents of the film (latent homosexuality, guilt, cross dressing, etc.)were not out of the ordinary. What was striking in the film was the deliberate, structured screenplay that made me recall early works of Marcel Carne. I was not surprised to learn that the screenplay won an award at the prestigious Venice Film Festival and nominated for a Cesar in France.<br /><br />The film's beginning and end revolve around affirmation of marital bonds, while the bulk of the film (to me only the sub-plot) ventures into transgression of those bonds followed by redemption. There is sadness at the end but it also accompanied by a silent studied reaffirmation of faith between man and wife. The final walk of the duo is an ordinary event yet captured powerfully in this film. I recommend this film to those who have not seen it not as a film that is extraordinary, but one which encourages viewers to introspect and look at ordinary lives, not of superheroes but of less than perfect men and women. The film succeeds because of low-keyed acting (Merhar and Miou-Miou), the sombre yet mesmerising music and good mise-en-scene. The film discusses ""drycleaning"" of two individuals' marital life, but the script and the director elevate the wife as strong personality with a level-headed strength developed quite unobtrusively as the film progresses. Anne Fontaine, the director, is someone to watch out for in the future as is Edouard Dubois. In more ways than one (direction, cinematography, the script) the film gives a woman's perspective of the story, though a wee bit sombre.",unsup

""Nettoyage à Sec"" is almost an excellent romance. The screenplay begins very daring, but the solution for the love situation is very moralist and resolved in a tragic, but easy way.

The husband's reaction is the key to the drama, and the actor's subtle signs of being tempted, against his nature and resisting all the way , are truly fine acting. The whole cast is excellent, and the sensual , open tone of the movie, mixing the fairly straight-laced couple, their young child, middle class friends and family, and the worldly young man and depicting them, ultimately, as not really all that different, is almost comforting...until that ending, which came rather fast and furious after a more slow moving development, shattering the mood.

10682_0,"(Includes a background of characters that reveals who they are, If you want to keep all that a surprise, don't read this review.)<br /><br />This movie is a movie that you feel okay with watching every once and awhile. It is one of my favorite Disney Channel Original Movies because it has a plot that you can follow. It also has a lot of people in the movie, making it a movie that all people can relate to because there is lots of different types of people as well. I liked it also because even though the family cast may not be the best of actors and actresses, they put together a family type of feeling that makes it seem like they are a family, even though they are not. The ideas that the movie used were pretty clever as well. The movie centers on a phantom terrorizing a big 26-screen movie theater. This is mainly a mystery as to who has been doing all of the unwanted actions in the theater.<br /><br />To give you a background and summary of the characters I'll tell you about the family in the movie. The main character is Pete Riley, played by Taylor Handley. He is the assistant manager of this big megaplex, which means he has a lot of responsibility and duties to bring about before his shift is over. He has two siblings in the movie, his younger sister, Karen, played by Caitlin Wachs, and his younger brother, Bryan, played by Jacob Smith. They are the typical type of a younger brother and sister that nag you and annoy you mainly because they are bored. Pete is the type of older brother that in a way, tolerates it. They have a mother as well, who is probably just your everyday mother that has her sternness and fun side. <br /><br />I think that Mickey Rooney, playing Movie Mason, did the best acting job. There were really no let-downs in this movie, but being a Disney Channel Original movie, it could have been better, only by adding more character development. This is a movie mainly for kids 6-11 or so. Teens may also enjoy it, only the teens today are mostly into PG-13 movies, not necessarily G movies. I enjoyed the movie because of the slight comedy, mystery, and some suspense. All in all it is worth it to see. Children will most definitely like it, maybe adults too.

Crazy movie where talking heads converse over how ""Brazilian"" society is under a moral collapse due to drugs and how the use of such provokes depravity and sadism. A series of stories, or various ways taboos can be tap-danced on with relish, alternate how characters do immoral things to each other..such as these sweaty men paying for a prostitute's method of defecation over a pot, how a group of hipsters fondle a school girl before murdering her with a stick in an act of indecency, a movie producer giving an actress seeking work the ""casting couch"" treatment whacking off as his pal rapes her, an act of adultery where the cheating woman alternates between pleasure and guilt over what she's doing as the grinning male has his way with her, a wealthy wife looks on as her black butler gives her daughter oral sex, etc. While not explicit, these stories are still lurid enough, photographed in B&W, and used as examples at moral decay with drugs being labeled the culprit. We have a psychiatric doctor interested in what actually provokes such behavior and seeks four volunteers for taking LSD recording their reactions using the image of Coffin Joe as a catalyst in tapping into the subconscious. The first hour is that collection of stories, and the final thirty minutes is the madness that is Coffin Joe running rampant in the nightmarish realm of these four selected ""victims"". The ""hallucinations"" are filmed in experimental colors and feature some pretty bizarre visuals like women being subjected to embarrassing ordeals, Joe often appearing and disappearing blowing flame from his hands(!), with those ""invaded"" by Joe baring witness to the frenzy of deranged images which pop up. My favorite image was of the women being knocked silly by Joe, landing at the feet of one volunteer as they kiss his feet. Another bizarre image I found memorable was the one volunteer(..the girl who defecated in the opening of this film)who is ""bombarded"" with marks of blood, smidgens here and there until she is covered.<br /><br />Oh, and there's this ""game show"" where Marins, as himself(..although the media and panel tend to refer to him as the evil character of Joe, perhaps a statement that some critics can not separate the creator from his creation), is subjected to a panel who question his art. This is witnessed by the psychiatrist who is inspired to run his ""LSD test"" using the character of Joe in his experiment.<br /><br />The group discussing the effects of drugs on the people also includes Marins, which makes this rather odd. The climactic scene puts everything into perspective, and is a nice sense of irony. I think, also, that this was ahead of the curve in that one might look at how the media and public at large indict horror and music, in this day and age, as channels for evil which only encourage those to commit crimes and perversion.

I have seen ""At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul"" and ""This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse"", and those are more in the horror vein, but this is more a commentary on the degradation of Brazilian society due to drugs and loose morals, it seems. And Coffin Joe seems to be to blame, oh yeah, right. It is rather amusing to see the ""drug addicts"" which look like middle-aged folks here, and some scenes which may have been meant to be somewhat frightening are actually more amusing than anything, at least these days. 4 people are chosen as part of an experiment with LSD and the focus of these experiments is the man himself, Xe Do Caixao, and at this point the film changes gears, switches from black and white to groovy color, and lets Marins cackle and leer his way through these poor folks bad trip. All along there's a panel discussion going on between folks that blame society's downfall on what they feel are subversive comics and movies. OK, so not much has changed in the world since the 60's, eh? Anyway, if you're interested the 3 films I mention are available separately or as part of the ""Coffin Joe Trilogy"", all are quite interesting in their own way and well worth seeing if you enjoy things that are 'different', and believe me, you can't get much different than these. 8 out of 10 and check it out.",unsup

However, it is his best, when all of his sub-Neitschze philosophy, violence, and common hatred for authority came together. Sure, its a bit of a mess as far as film-making goes, but its a fascinating mess nonetheless. Its an interesting parable on how the government uses scapegoats such as drugs and violent cinema (particularly that of Marins' films which were subjected to much censorship) to cover up other issues. For its subversive story, it was banned in Brazil until 1986.<br /><br />Marins was always a talented if raw filmmaker. His roughie segments at the beginning are disturbing and even gross, but they contribute to the power of the film. The final LSD sequence is one of the most amazing ever caught on film. The trip sequence is comprised of censored scenes from earlier Coffin Joe films and new footage. Viewing this, its no wonder the government was horrified and called for it to be banned. In his homeland, Marins is a renowned cult figure. Unfortuantly his unique cinema isn't appreciated too much outside of Brazil.

10691_0,"This film about a murder case, about the trial after it, is one of these American films, in fact a TV mini-series, on a real case that does not go in the normal direction, the direction of what we all should think not truth is but justice should be. There is such an enormous amount of doubt about the case, about the guilt and even about the murder itself that it is unbelievable that a unanimous verdict of guilt came out of the jury pool. Such cases are examples for us to question the system of justice we set up over the last four centuries. And the judge decided to impose life imprisonment but for first degree murder it could have been the death penalty. It is such cases that prove that jury justice is maybe good in many cases but there are a few cases where it is the worst possible system, and that is why the death penalty should be gotten rid of, and that's why we should make sure the defendants, now sentenced culprits, have access to all possibilities and opportunities to appeal the decision and to have the best councilors available. Jury justice in a world that is so deeply cut in small antagonistic pieces does not work in any sensitive delicate case because of any kind of un-namable bias having to do with race, wealth, age, sex, sexual orientation, and any other parameter you may think of. This case should be compared to other cases where the reverse decision was reached, but the model of such a case of failed justice was clearly written in a book and set to the screen a long time ago: ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"". Miscarriage of justice due to some kind of totally unmentionable prejudice.

Director Lestrade obviously has condensed the trial and chosen scenes to further his point of view but much of the evidence and many of the submissions had no place in a trial seeking truth and justice. Lestrade did not stage events that showed the prosecutors creating jury prejudice, he reported on them.<br /><br />Judge Hudson allowed an immunized gay hooker to testify about Internet chats with Peterson. The only purpose was to demean Peterson for his sexual interests. It certainly was not to add information about a homicide because the witness had never met Peterson face to face nor had any direct contact with the defendant or his family. The only information he could provide about the Peterson's marriage was Michael's repeated statements about love for his wife Kathleen. Similarly, evidence about gay pornography on Peterson's computer was, by itself, prejudicial. No testimony supported the notion that the material offended the dead woman but assistant prosecutor Freda Black certainly was highly offended by what she called filth.<br /><br />The prosecution failed to establish a believable motive for murder of Kathleen Peterson. They suggested she was soon to lose her lucrative employment and that might cause Peterson to prefer her dead. Alternatively, they said that Kathleen might have been so offended by newly discovering his gay interest that she would end their relationship.<br /><br />The most egregious act of the prosecution was to claim parallels between Kathleen's 2001 death with the death of a Peterson family friend in Germany in 1985. Her death 18 years before Peterson's trial was found by investigation at the time to be by natural causes. <br /><br />Lestrade's film is probably most powerful in the way it presents the Peterson family dynamics. The natural and adopted children stood by the defendant throughout the trial and that presents the strongest evidence of innocence.<br /><br />Despite my comments above, I am not convinced that Michael Peterson is innocent.

The film demonstrates how expert witnesses are selected and coached so that the presentation to the jury becomes a calculated performance. The facts of a case are seen as nothing more than elements in a construction to portray the defendant in the most positive light. Truth is of secondary importance, and it is clear that in the American justice system, only the wealthy can receive anything approaching fairness. If you are a fan of The Courtroom Procedural, THE STAIRCASE is well worth your attention. Superb soundtrack by Jocelyn Pook.",unsup
10694_0,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! I am from Durham, North Carolina where this took place. My family even knew Michael. I live a few blocks from the Cedar St home, and was shocked when I heard what happened. ""Poor Michael.."" I thought. What I was to learn about this man many of my family members and friends of my family called a friend would shock me. All things considered, I think the case is still extremely circumstantial, and the reasonable doubt is there. Can you move past the physical evidence and get into the science? I am not completely convinced as to his guilt OR his innocence, but I think the criminal justice system failed him. Was his bisexuality an issue? No. Was Elizabeth Ratliff an issue according to the events of December 9th, 2001? Most certainly not. In the end, the trial wasn't even about Kathleen anymore, but more so about trying to paint Michael as sinister a man as there could possibly be.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great documentary, and I highly recommend this to everyone. Jim Hardin says this case is about pretenses and appearances, but look deeper into those, from both sides. Not even a Hollywood writer could make a script this compelling.<br /><br />10/10.",unsup
10695_0,"(I tried not to spoil anything, but I clicked the spoiler alert just in case.)<br /><br />The Staircase was accidentally absorbing. Even though the filmmakers had an unmistakably obvious point of view, they did not succeed in persuading me to the same conclusion. Yet, to Maha's credit, the film was thoroughly engaging from beginning to end. Most of the characters it dwelled on were so despicable, transparent, and sad that I can think of no real life situation where I'd have spent more than five minutes in the company of such people. But it was tolerable and even darkly fascinating to observe them on screen over the course of this enthralling real life documentary. <br /><br />Since I first watched the film, I've read an excellent book by Diane Fanning about the Michael Peterson case. I recommend it to all -- titled ""Written In Blood."" My instincts, according to this exceptionally well researched, well written book, were pretty solid as it turns out. Common sense served me well, and I believe common sense prevailed in the face of a million+ bucks in ""expert obfuscation"" and P.R. hi-jinx -- AKA David Rudolph's High Powered Legal Defense Team. <br /><br />I can say without reservation, The Staircase is highly entertaining and well crafted. Yet I must encourage viewers to balance the heavily one-sided array of facts and suggestions by consulting additional sources. There are a number of places online offering background, evidence, testimony, and opinion. Or get one straightforward, well organized, and riveting account in Fanning's book. After bulking up your knowledge of the opposing viewpoint and forensic evidence, watch The Staircase a second time and experience a whole new set of ""Aha!"" moments.<br /><br />One other spectacular element that must be mentioned: the exquisite and haunting original music composed (and performed?) by Jocelyn Pook. Hats off to the directors for spotting this amazing talent.",unsup
10696_0,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!! (I suggest you read this after having seen the film) I don't know if what I'm gonna say can be regarded as a ""spoiler"", because after all, this is a documentary and maybe a lot of people know what happened. It's quite impossible too to discuss this without giving away the ending.<br /><br />This documentary (though this one plays out like a terrific film) chronicles the trial of Michael Peterson, but at the same time tells you more about morality, prejudice, justice and Southern mentality than you could've imagined. The director used a fly-on-the-wall approach to the subject, which was very appropriate in my opinion, though some people clearly regarded this as being biased. But you can't argue what you CAN see in the film...<br /><br />Now let me start by saying that I won't go into details about the case (in which novelist Michael Peterson was found guilty of murdering his then wife, Kathleen; the case is now up for appeal, by the way). The facts, testimonies, evidence, etc. you have to see for yourself, whether it be in this documentary, television footage or in some archive. I won't even go so far as to say that Michael Peterson didn't murder his wife, because after all I wasn't present at the trial (and even that isn't always a guarantee for justice) and I've only been offered this material in the form of a documentary (by French film maker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade) of about 6 hours. So maybe he did it, maybe he didn't. But I've studied the law myself for several years here in Belgium and after having seen this film and having read about the case whatever I could find, I really can't conclude otherwise than by saying that there's at least enough reasonable doubt to set Peterson free.<br /><br />For me, more important than the technical discussions in the film (some people seem to KNOW that for example doctor Henry Lee sold out to the defense side), is the human and moral aspect at play here. I díd see the four sons and daughters of Michael Peterson standing behind their (step-)father all the way (with the exception of Kathleen's daughter Caitlin). I díd hear prosecutor Freda Black talk about the ""filth"" she found on Peterson's computer, talking about the homosexual pornography she found (""no relationship, but pure sex"") and the triumphant look in the other prosecutor Jim Hardin's eyes (though he did his best not to show it) when he found the pornography. For these people it was apparent that the dubious sexual ways of Peterson were enough from the start to declare him guilty. I can't even begin to understand how it is possible that the homosexual stuff was allowed in the trial, or how it was possible that the autopsy report (by the clearly highly incompetent ""expert"" Deborah Radisch (does she even know she's not allowed to make judgments in her report?)) was put out on the internet, before the case started.<br /><br />Worst of all however, I was shocked by the decision of the prosecutors to bring the death of Elizabeth Ratliff (a close friend of Peterson, about twenty years ago, who died in ""similar"" circumstances) into play here (they even dug up her corpse again). What were they trying to prove with that? That Peterson is a serial killer who strikes once every twenty years in the proximity of a staircase? Well, that doesn't go with the theory of Kathleen Peterson finding out about his bisexuality and getting herself killed. What was the motive of Peterson in the Ratliff case by the way? Not one single answer on that by the prosecutors.<br /><br />No murder weapon, not a decent motive and not one decent theory by the prosecutor about how Michael Peterson could have killed his wife (judge for yourself when you see the staircase of the title). But a lot of dirty tricks, e.g. bringing in Peterson's sexuality, his writings (fiction!) and the death of Elizabeth Ratliff, and plenty of wild theories (e.g. the blow-poke). For me that's enough (multiplied by ten) to conclude there's reasonable doubt in this case, but the jurors concluded otherwise. Beyond a reasonable doubt is a fine concept, too bad some people use it so light-heartedly.<br /><br />But it's not hard to guess why Peterson was convicted. Not because the prosecutors showed he was guilty, but because he's bisexual, quite rich and white (a majority of the jurors and the judge were black), and because, well, let's face it, the juror system simply doesn't work. The prosecutors knew very well which buttons to push (the emotional and moral ones, not too surprising in these Bush times) and even after all had been said and done (and Hardin and Black clearly didn't even have faith in a guilty verdict anymore), those issues simply made the difference. So what if there's no proof, we can't stand the man, 'kay? I could comment on the dubious role the judge (allow everything, no matter if it's relevant; if it can hurt Peterson, bring it on), some media (ignore what's been said on the trial, ask silly questions and make up a story of your own), the police, medical examiner Radisch and some of Kathleen Peterson's relatives (I understand their grief, but what her sisters did was preposterous) played here, but enough for now. You be the judge.<br /><br />Like Peterson's lawyer said (more or less): ""The outcome did not surprise me. It shook the foundations of my belief in the justice system, in humanity, morality and myself."" I doubt if the world we're living in today is as safe as some people will have us believe. Just look around you. Who would like to be judged by such ""peers""?",unsup
10697_0,"Now we're on the weak end of the 'Lone Star' westerns. Unless you've never seen any of them, this is a retread of several tropes from earlier films in the series. If this is your first, the surprises at the end (which is well edited) will be new. Sorry to have to spoil your fun.<br /><br />We get that dynamite is needed to clear the trail; dynamite is used to get water flowing in the superior first film 'Riders of Destiny' (1933). We get that John Wayne has really been sent by the government to work undercover and infiltrate the gang of outlaws; as also seen in 'Riders of Destiny,' and countless other early thirties westerns such as 'The Man From Hell's Edges' (1932) with Bob Steele, etc.<br /><br />We get Lucille Brown as the ""Prairie Flower,"" and Leroy Mason as the head villain, also from the better 'Texas Terror' (1935) in which Lucille gets more screen time than the villain, and when finding out that John Wayne is indeed a good guy at the end, rushes to his cabin to spend two hours alone with him! Unfortunately, she's wasted here with little to do. We get the Tin Lizzie driven by George Hayes, also featured in 'Texas Terror.' Note: In this film he sings a song! Now, if you don't think he's acting trying to walk and talk like an old geezer, watch him as the nasty, dastardly villain in the awful serial 'The Lost City'( 1935) ! We get shots of Yakima Canutt jumping on a horse, and plunging off a cliff into a river, among many shots repeated from earlier films in the series.<br /><br />So what does it all mean? A weak Lone Star. When you have two extensive shootouts between the road workers and the villain's gang of henchmen behind rocks in a canyon, nobody, not even the camera, is moving. Surprise, that means that the film isn't moving either! It's better to spend your time on the 'Lone Stars' with either better character development or better action such as 'Sagebrush Trail' (1933),'The Star Packer' (1934), 'The Trail Beyond' (1934), 'The Dawn Rider' (1935) or 'Texas Terror' (1935). Despite the well paced ending, this one gets a 3.",unsup

He sure doesn't look comfortable serenading the heroine or warbling a tune while riding across the prairie.

The obligatory romantic interest is as boring as it gets.

106_0,"This film is about 30 years old. I know of no conversions to tape or DVD. It had a theatrical run of about two weeks partially due to a bad review but nobody I ever met who saw it disliked the picture. The reviewer either never actually saw the entire film or had an agenda to sink it. When I first saw it my girlfriend (who isn't Jewish) and I and the vast majority of the audience, were roaring with laughter. We returned a number of times with friends and family and everyone loved it.<br /><br />13 years later I had the privilege of having Sid Ceasar in my car (I was hired to take him to his hotel) and I asked him about the film. He said that he had a lot of fun making the movie, but the studio provided very limited money to advertise and promote the product. No press, no promotion. Studio politics.<br /><br />Gardenia (overbearing father) and Medford (sweet, but loopy wife and mother) are the parents of Arkin, the older son who lives outside the family home and Reiner (intimidated, milquetoast) who lives in. The family owns a failing, indebted department store. Arkin is married to Anjanette Comer, who desperately wants a child. Arkin claims he is impotent because of the tyranny of his father and the fact that he is the hated high school basketball coach whose team can't even win one game. Ceasar plays a wacky WWII patient at the the VA hospital who still believes that the war is still ongoing.<br /><br />On a road trip to Florida, Gardenia secretly sets into motion a scheme to burn his Dept. store down and collect the Fire Insurance. Arkin and Reiner think that his parents' absence presents the perfect opportunity to prove their father wrong and refurbish and restock the store and make a success of it. They don't know of the plot and go to work. Ceasar as Gardenia's unwitting foil is priceless. The pace of the film accelerates and is replete with a few clever twists. This effort is worth a sincere second look and a re-release.",unsup
10700_0,"And with John Wayne and Gabby Hayes, what else could it be? For the time, and given that this IS one of those B movies churned out constantly by the various production companies, this thing is a hoot. Its fun for fans of the Duke, seeing him in such an early role. It has its elements of excitement and plot twists. It has its style of humor, fitting for the day. Its honestly well put together for the time. None of the other players are bad actors, and several are very good. The villains, Buffalo Bill Jr. ( aka Butch Galt ) and LeRoy Mason in particular, were both very fine actors and come across quite well in their roles. The plot? Its not complicated, but it makes for a good story. Fight scenes? Several. Just keep in mind that choreography was not then what it is now. When I watch something like this I try to put myself in the time during which the flick was made. That seems to put it into perspective and helps make it a lot more entertaining. If you can wrap your head around the era, recognize that churning out B movies doesn't necessarily mean poor quality as a standard, and be thankful that Wayne doesn't sing in this one ... Rainbow Valley? Well, pilgrim, it ain't a big valley, but it is a fun one.",unsup
10701_0,"If you have read my other reviews of Chaplin's comedy shorts, you may have noticed that I have generally given very poor reviews of films made during his first couple years in Hollywood (1914-1915). In general, they had no script or direction, were never really edited and just weren't particularly funny. In addition, Chaplin had a lot to learn about and develop regarding his Little Tramp character.<br /><br />In light of this, it was so nice to see this film. Unlike most other films of 1914, this film had a strong plot with a definite beginning, middle and end--something often lacking in his other films. Plus, it had some genuine laughs. So, for newcomers to the films of Chaplin, it's an excellent introduction.<br /><br />Charlie and Chester Conklin (a perennial Keystone actor) work in a combination restaurant and bakery. The bakers go out on strike and the two fellas are forced to do duty in the bakery. There is still a lot of punching and kicking and throwing of dough, but the plot becomes a lot more serious when the disgruntled bakers sneak some dynamite into the ovens!

10703_0,"Finally a movie for us: the people who were entranced by the romance of musical theater at a young age. This film captures the longing, the enthusiasm, and the emotional growing pains of a group of teen agers attending a performing arts summer camp. The musical numbers are simply stunning, often hilarious, and leave you exhilarated at the exuberant talent on display. And what numbers! Songs from Follies, Dreamgirls, Promises Promises, an incredible Bob Telson song (from The Gospel at Colonus)which opens the film, and several new songs written by Steven Trask (of Hedwig and the Angry Inch fame)and others.<br /><br />While the script remains frustratingly superficial when exploring the film's central romantic triangle, and in spite of its lopsided focus on the tribulations of the one straight male character, Camp still offers many characters and scenes that delight.

So you can't really dislike the film.<br /><br />However, the bad far outweighs the good. Director/writer Todd Graf has done good work as an actor, but his dual turn here is far from promising. The dreadful script leaves no tired cliche or cliched character unturned & the dialogue is stilted and amateurish. <br /><br />Some of the scenes are just plain unbelievable (e.g. the straight hunk suddenly trying to come on to the gay kid). Some are groan-inducing: for example, when the group starts doing a new piece by the cynical, self-pitying, alcoholic composer, it brings him around and he joins the band.<br /><br />Also, the film stretches credibility with some of the choices of shows the kids do - would anyone really try to put on a production of ""Follies"" or ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" with teenagers? These scenes exist for nothing more than easy laughs.<br /><br />The cast of unknowns are a mixed lot - some are more personable than others, some are a little awkward, but the dialogue doesn't help any of them.<br /><br />Graf based this film on his own experiences at a summer theater camp for teens, but you'd never know it.

There was one at the end (about the alcoholic teacher who ""finds"" himself) that was so old that I couldn't believe I was seeing it in a 2003 film. Also characters appear and disappear with no warning (who WAS that handsome Latino boy who was buddy buddy with Michael in one scene) and some of the performances were either overdone (some of the gay boys were doing everything but lisping) or pretty bad (Daniel Letterle is VERY handsome--but he can't act and he grins way too much). <br /><br />So why am I giving it a 7? There is some good acting (Joanna Chilcoat and Robin de Jesus are standouts) and the musical numbers. These kids can REALLY belt out songs and the dancing is incredible. Those musical numbers alone make the film worth seeing.

1071_0,"It really makes no sense how this film could not have worked. Working off a script based on a Robert A. Heinlein novel, with the venerable Donald Sutherland in one of the lead roles, and with alien invasion the subject matter, this should have been at least a seven star Science Fiction film. As Sci-Fi goes, the superior ones focus more on futuristic and/or scientific concepts, with action and/or special effects adding to the spectacle. That is why films like the Star Wars saga really aren't Sci-Fi, but action/adventure first (and in the case of Star Wars, fantasy) and science fiction second at best. This film does delve into the biology and culture of the aliens, but just barely. Mostly it focuses on hokey special effects and a few watered-down action scenes to fill up screen time. The aliens themselves are quite realistic and original, a plus for the film. The chemistry between Donald Sutherland as the leader of a secret government agency and his son, played by Eric Thal (an unknown at the time) is actually quite good. In addition, Julie Warner actually does well as the scientist working for Sutherland and of course plays the romantic interest for Sutherland's son. While not a superior actress, she performs adequately, although her talents are more suited to television, as it appears this movie was. While most will think, as I did, while reading the plot synopsis of the film that it is a rip-off of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (Sutherland starred in the remake of this film in 1978), the actual book was published in 1951, prior to the original film as well as the novel written by Jack Finney. Bottom line: not a bad movie to watch when you know you will be distracted as it requires very little of your attention and there are enough action scenes to move the pace along, but science fiction and Heinlein fans will be disappointed.",unsup

One of these is the challenge of a profession in the arts. I loved the way it dealt with all of the issues it raised. For all of the criticism from the other reviews, I found this movie did a better job of raising all of the issues it raises and getting me to think about them, but more from a personal standpoint, and not from so much of a societal standpoint. We each have a role to play in each issue and we each have the challenge of deciding what we are going to do with each. Part of it is understanding other people.

10724_0,"SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!!! The most amazing thing about this film is that Steven Sondheim actually agreed to play himself in it. You'd think he had better taste.<br /><br />Camp is really one of the most unprofessional films I have seen in a long time (except perhaps for the musicians).<br /><br />First of all, the sets look like they were made on the lowest of budgets.<br /><br />Second, it was totally clichéd and you could figure out where it was going looooong before it got there. There was almost nothing in it that was original...we have seen it all before and much better done.<br /><br />Third... it is an insult to our intelligence. Three gay guys and a straight share the same bunkhouse and the straight doesn't feel even a little uncomfortable? At almost the end of the film the straight guy takes off his shirt and the gay guy gets all hot and bothered...ummmm...if they share the same bunkhouse, wouldn't he have already seen it weeks ago? The rich beautiful girl just drops her bags and the other girl picks them up and becomes her slave? Pul-leeze! Also, how does she end up getting a bunkhouse with a bed that looks like it should have been Mae West's? How come she isn't sharing a bunkhouse like all the other girls? The acting was pretty low par...I barely believed any of them except maybe the black kid who complained about playing white parts in the plays...But then again, I guess it is hard to make cardboard characters come to life, so I guess it isn't the kids' fault if the acting comes across as less than acceptable.<br /><br />Need I go on? This whole thing comes across as a TV sitcom that would have been acceptable in the 1950's but would have been considered as not sophisticated enough for a ten year old by today's standards.<br /><br />Oh, and, for a film that is supposed to be gay positive, how come the main character is the only straight boy in the entire movie? We see three girls and one gay boy all having crushes on Mr Hetero... but none of the gay boys gets a chance to have a boyfriend. Why not? It would have livened things up a bit to have at least an attempt at equality. Or aren't gay romances (that aren't doomed) acceptable for the straight market?",unsup
10725_0,"As an adult viewer, I had to think back and view the movie through the eyes of a teenager in order to appreciate it. And in doing so, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Camp. Some of the dialogue is awkward, and the story lines don't always wrap up quite neatly, or at least not ideally. But that's how life is, especially during the often awkward adolescent years, and the emotional realism is touching.<br /><br />Though it loses momentum at times, the movie never loses my interest because of it's strong characters, great musical numbers, and its fanciful--though a bit unrealistic--depiction of this teen-drama-summer camp world that I barely knew existed. And it's a particular world that most people have never experienced, but anybody who's ever felt awkward as a teenager can relate to this movie. Though never an aspiring actor or singer, I certainly related, and I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure if Camp fits neatly into the musical genre, and I don't care. I do know that I couldn't even watch the first 10 minutes of the new Hairspray musical with John Travolta. It repulsed me. But I love Camp, (as I do Dancer in the Dark) which in my non-musical-expert opinion, has too much music-less dialogue, thankfully, to be considered a true musical. This favorable review of Camp is from someone who generally hates musicals.",unsup

A delightful memoir and tribute to what it's like to be young and hopeful about a career in the arts.<br /><br />This movie is beyond words when it comes to being a unique feel-good movie. At some points, however, I felt like the kids were almost unbelieveable as angsty teenagers. The plot seemed a little disjointed too; Vlad's character continually reveals more complexity and conflict up until the very end, and I felt like I was just getting to know him when the movie finishes. However, they pale in comparison to the excellent musical numbers and sheer emotion that reaches beyond the kids' ages.<br /><br />Graff made a gem of a movie. For anyone who's into musical theatre, or was when they were younger, can relate to this movie. If you haven't, you see a pretty picture of a movie, with spectacular musical numbers (""Ladies who Lunch,"" ""Turkey Lurkey Time,"" ""Want of a Nail""). My only qualms with it are the gay stereotypes seemingly sticking here, and a couple other inconsistencies of character. But nothing much.

It's a teen drama!"" In fact, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have worked if the film tried to be more grown-up. To properly enjoy ""Camp"", adult viewers need to recall their world view during their teen years. Only then can they realize how much they would have wanted to see a movie like this when they were teens.

1072_0,"Despite being one of the key dozen or so science fiction writers of the 20th Century, relatively little of Robert Heinlein's work has been filmed and, with the exception of Starship Troopers (turned on its idealogical head), nothing from the 60s onwards, when his work started to carry more serious subtext.<br /><br />The Puppet Masters, a book from the 50s, is essentially fairly lightweight albeit the invasion motif is similar to that of much 1950s science fiction in echoing a fear about the spread of communism - indeed, the parasitic slugs in Puppet Masters form a single entity - a commune if you will - and are therefore a fairly obvious analogue for the red menace. The novel was also fairly saucy for its time, with large chunks of the population having to peel down to their skivvies and beyond to prove that their clothing was not hiding the alien slugs.<br /><br />Well, as usual, Hollywood doesn't like to present the naked body to the viewing public, so the protagonists in this film version of Heinlein's story encounter more difficulty than they need to, simply by virtue of everybody keeping their clothes on. Apart from that, it follows the main sequence of events fairly faithfully, albeit updated to be more contemporary.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland is a serviceable ""Old Man"", albeit quite different to how I imagined the character from the book (which hardly matters). There are several well-known albeit minor names in the secondary case, but the main leads are taken by Eric Thal and Julie Warner. Neither has had major success before or since (Warner had a lengthy run in Family Law) and, to be perfectly frank, this movie gives a good idea why - they have little charisma, and no chemistry despite the fact that they supposedly fall in love during the film The story demands lead players who don't come across as insipid, but it doesn't get them.<br /><br />There is relatively little in terms of special effects, but what there is does the job. The major effect is the slugs themselves, and they are pleasingly unpleasant..<br /><br />There is some offensive - and entirely unnecessary - use of the F-bomb. I don't mind it when it's there for a purpose: here it service no purpose whatsoever. It doesn't advance the plot or illuminate character, it simply makes an unpleasant comment even more unpleasant, and it could have been omitted entirely without any detrimental effect on the movie.<br /><br />With some promotion, this movie could have been rather more successful than it was, albeit it came on the heels of what might have appeared to be similar epidemic-type stories. Perhaps Heinlein's time in movies is still to come.",unsup

The characters are realistic and fun, and the song choices are consistently good (especially ""Turkey Lurkey Time"" which is otherwise unavailable on film, far as I know). The original songs (from the people who brought you ""Fame"") are also good--occasionally terrific.<br /><br />It's interesting to me that among a cast of newcomers and unknowns, the worst performances are from the adults--especially Don Dixon (Bert).

It's clearly a Corman knock-off of earlier brother avenges brother efforts, but it's head and shoulders above most of the crumby video fodder that was being fed to the hungry market at the time. <br /><br />Jerry Trimble is good as the kickboxing hayseed who comes to LA to find his brother, but Marcus Aurelius steals the show as Pep, the Art of War spouting trainer who befriends Luke. Watching these two train, fight, and of course bond, was surprisingly effective, considering how badly written and acted most of these cheapy fight vehicles were at the time. <br /><br />This flick is pure comic book fun as Luke and Pep fight their way up the ladder of villainous opponents to the championship-and the truth of Luke's brother's death. Beverly Grey (writer) and Rick Jacobson (director) set up each opponent, so each fight has special meaning. This movie really delivers on the awesome fights. It's non-stop, yet stylistic. Kudos to the editor (Lawrence Maddox) because this thing moves. Jacobson has real flair here, and the final fight, even if you saw it coming, is a blast. <br /><br />If you know this genre, you'll recognize many of the much used locations from other Corman flicks.

Perhaps Stalin's greatest victory was to leave to posterity so few living enemies that even today he is the subject of worship by so many Russians.

10739_0,"This is a tremendously moving documentary about suffering and sacrifices in the Soviet Union during the Stalin years. It includes little-seen film footage of the pre-World War II years, and striking images throughout. There are also interviews with survivors of the Gulags and World War II, and with some individuals who were directly acquainted with Stalin. The musical sound track nicely enhances the program, and I think that Nigel Hawthorne's dispassionate narration is very good--much more effective than a melodramatic reading would be. While the program is very educational, I also found it to be emotionally and intellectually gripping, and artfully done throughout.<br /><br />Some of the marketing of ""Russia's War"" misleadingly suggests that it is entirely about the World War II years. While the program covers the war on the Russian Front in-depth, it also contains significant portions that describe the years before and after the war. This includes Stalin's consolidation of power, his attempts to establish a Communist industrial power, the purges and many other crimes committed by the Communist regime during his rule, and the end of Stalin. Sadly, many people outside of the former Warsaw Pact nations are much less acquainted with the atrocities of the Communists than with those which were committed by the Nazis. One of the reasons for this might be the relatively small amount of film footage of the Gulags and other Communist camps that has been shown in the West. ""Russia's War"" presents haunting images of persons being tried in Communist show trials, transported to labor camps, and working in slave labor projects (Anne Applebaum's book Gulag offers a useful history of the Gulag system, in case this documentary encourages you to read further). Also, watch for some film footage showing an assembly of Communists who are desperate to show their devotion to Stalin--it is a small yet clear example of the absurd level which Communist totalitarianism reached.<br /><br />Much time is also spent on the World War II years, including the experiences of all levels of the military and civilians. Interviews are included with servicemen and women of various branches, resistance fighters, and several civilians. The major campaigns are covered, such as the opening of Barbarossa, the German drive towards Moscow, the Siege of Leningrad, the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk, and the Soviet advance towards Germany. Some lesser-known incidents are described also, such as the self-sacrifice of some very young Soviet soldiers in front of Moscow. Pictures of these soldiers are shown while Hawthorne describes their fate, briefly but very movingly.<br /><br />A little-known element of the war which is explored is the relationship between civilians, Soviet partisans and other resistance groups. Some resistance groups fought both the Nazis and the Soviets, and many civilians were also caught in the middle. While the Soviet partisans accomplished much against the Germans, many of them were far from being the heroes which Soviet propaganda claimed.<br /><br />Other aspects of how Soviet civilians survived and died in the countryside and the cities are investigated, including the massive suffering of Jews under both Hitler and Stalin.<br /><br />The program does not include interviews with Germans who were involved in the war and occupation in Russia, although this is to be expected because of the focus of the documentary. ""Russia's War"" does include a wealth of film footage showing the German military in action, and scenes behind the German lines.<br /><br />It also presents one of the most haunting images of misery that I have seen: the face of a Soviet soldier who is wearily eating while on the march, and who looks towards the camera. Sadly, this program presents many other images which are comparable. At the same time, along with all of the misery and oppression that is documented, there are stories included that are deeply inspiring.",unsup

His mug is prominently featured in the robbery photos and then the fun ensues when he goes to his ex-wife's (Hawn's) house to engender her help after being let go by the robbers and being fully on the run from the law.<br /><br />The movie is mostly fast-paced slapstick farce, a host of retreaded clichés (the dogs, for example), and quick jokes. Charles Grodin is actually quite funny and charming as her straight-arrow District Attorney (soon to be Attorney General) husband, Ira. Given ""Midnight Run,"" I think Grodin should be considered a mint for American glib comedy a la Albert Brooks.<br /><br />It's pointless to go much deeper into the story as the plot merely drives slapstick scenes one into the next. The story is essentially the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Goldie Hawn is in full-tilt cutie mode (she really was a doll) but carries the movie very well as a hopeless do-gooder who wants to help everybody, including her ex-husband and every stray dog in 10 surrounding counties. Chevy Chase often gives the impression of making comedy look effortless (think Fletch), but he is REALLY giving into pratfalling a la his SNL days in this one.

1074_0,"Problem #1: The chief problem with this film is its ridiculous screenplay. The film can't decide if it wants to be a mindless action flick or a character-driven sci-fi drama. So what you get is an alien invasion story where all the leads get ""infected"" by the aliens but are somehow saved by their friends while scores of infected extras get mowed down by machine-gun fire. If a lead character is infected, their buddies come up with all sorts of ways to peel the alien critter off, but if Farmer Joe comes running at them with a lug wrench, no one hesitates to pump him full of holes.<br /><br />Problem #2: Richard Belzer is in this movie and he is given not a single funny line! SPOILER: When his character ices himself, I felt like it was Richard Belzer's way of saying, ""This flick stinks, I'm outta here."" Problem #3: The final, cliché helicopter action sequence. It seemed like it they filmed it for another movie or something and just tagged it onto the end of this one.",unsup
10750_0,"Amiable Neil Simon farce about good-hearted defense attorney Glenda Parks (Goldie Hawn), who's a sucker for hard luck cases and even incorrigible types. She's married to district attorney Ira Parks (Charles Grodin), who's about to campaign for attorney general. Into their lives comes her ex-husband Nick Gardenia (Chevy Chase), who just won't leave her alone. As the story begins, Nick is forced by two criminals to participate in a bank robbery and when they let him go (albeit while their vehicle is in motion), Nick figures Glenda - who he's never stopped loving - will be the only one willing to help him.<br /><br />Hawn, Grodin, and Chase are all cast in parts perfect for each. (As a matter of fact, the entire film is cast well right down the line.) Chase gets to toss off his trademark wiseacre quips and even indulge in a little physical comedy. Hawn is just as sweet as could be and Grodin is in fine grumpy form. And they're supported well by the other actors, including Robert Guillaume as Grodins' colleague, George Grizzard as the governor, and Harold Gould as the judge who has to watch as his courtroom turns into a circus. Particularly fun are Yvonne Wilder as harried maid Aurora and T.K. Carter as kleptomaniac turned chauffeur Chester.<br /><br />The film itself marks a capable theatrical debut for Jay Sandrich, a man who honed his craft working on many TV series over the years. At one point, Gould remarks during the climactic trial how he loves it when time flies by. Well, time flies by watching this film as well. It's quite entertaining with not one dull moment. Simons' script is quite funny and spirited, with a dinner party rating as a real comedic highlight. It's all good-natured fun from its beginning to its end.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of the writer and the stars.<br /><br />8/10",unsup
10751_0,"After teaming up in ""Foul Play,"" Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn reunite in this Neil Simon send-up of and tribute to those old-fashioned screwball comedies. It seems that Chevy was minding his own business, when he is kidnapped to rob a bank by two ex-cons, who make a habit of getting trusting faces to do their work for them. They go through with it, with Chevy staring right into the security camera. Being thrown from a moving car afterwards, a bruised Chevy makes his way to his ex-wife, Goldie, who, of course, is now married to the county d.a., played wonderfully by Charles Grodin.<br /><br />At first, it reminded of me ""The Talk of the Town,"" the one where Cary Grant is wanted by the law and Jean Arthur gives him shelter, unwillingly. Then, it felt like those Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies. Then, as it neared its wacky courtroom end, it felt like ""What's Up, Doc?"" which was a remake of ""Bringing Up Baby."" With me throwing all these names at you, do you feel like watching an old movie? <br /><br />Well, this will do. The stars' chemistry and charm make for most of the appeal, and it is quite easy to take and pleasant with its presence of 80s stars George Grizzard, T.K. Carter, and Robert Guillaume (from ""Soap"" and ""Benson."") Having said that, it's not as good as Simon's greatest films, like ""The Odd Couple,"" ""The Sunshine Boys,"" and others. (I keep thinking though that 7 is too low and 8 is just a little high. As it won't take a 7.5, I'll give an '8' to give it the benefit of the doubt.) But it is much better than ""Foul Play,"" whose main asset besides Goldie was the very funny Dudley Moore.<br /><br />The viewer may be left wondering about the ending, though. It makes me feel like Neil Simon didn't quite know how to end it, for it stops very abruptly. But, if you're in the mood for some madcap shenanigans and haven't ever seen this, you're in for a treat. ""Seems Like Old Times"" makes for a good time, courtesy of Neil Simon.",unsup

Every actor was wonderful, and I find it difficult to pick one out as the best. T.K.

When ""Glenda"" told ""Nick"" to give himself up, she said ""If you're innocent they will never send you to jail."" Nick responds by asking ""Chester"" if thats how it works, ""Chester"" responds, ""Not in my neighborhood."" Charles Grodin was great as ""Glenda's"" husband ""Ira."" I also wasn't that impressed with the scene in the guest room with Chase under the bed while Grodin was sitting on it. I loved that line, however, by Grodin where he said, ""oh, he was limping.

10753_0,"This film was a sequel film to a better comedy: FOUL PLAY which was made in 1976 and co-starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn. In that one the former was a police officer who is trying to protect the Pope on a visit to San Francisco, and the latter is an innocent by-stander who stumbles into the details of an assassination plot. The story worked with the assistance of Dudley Moore as a befuddled not-so-innocent third party who gets dragged into the proceedings by Hawn, Eugene Roche as a conspirator, Billy Barty as an accidental victim of Hawn's fears and hysteria, and Burgess Meredith and Rachel Roberts having an unexpected classic judo face off. Oh, all to the concluding music from Act I of Gilbert and Sullivan's THE MIKADO.<br /><br />SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES is a remake of sorts of the 1942 film THE TALK OF THE TOWN. That film dealt with Cary Grant as a fugitive being hidden in a house by Jean Arthur, while jurist Ronald Colman (just nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court) is renting the same house from Arthur. Here Chase is the fugitive, hiding in the garage of his first wife Hawn, unbeknown-st to her second husband Charles Grodin (who is being considered for the post of Attorney General of California. The screenplay is by Neil Simon this time, and there is good supporting roles by Robert Guillaume, George Grizzard, and Harold Gould (as an increasingly annoyed local judge). However, TALK OF THE TOWN was dealing with a man accused of an arson murder due to his labor union activities. Grant was an activist in that film. Chase comes across as something of a schmuck here - he is forced at gunpoint to assist two men in a bank robbery, is set up to deliver the note to the teller, gets his face photographed too well by the bank's camera, and is then tossed out of the speeding car on a hillside by the two felons. The audience knows Chase is innocent, and gradually Hawn and Grondin and Guillaume realize it too. But it seems that Chase had a similar bad experience in Mexico regarding being framed for a drug deal - and had spent some time in prison as a result there. He seems to be an unlucky sort.<br /><br />The weaknesses of Chase's character aside, SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES is funny, and understandably so - it has a Neil Simon script. In fact, aside from the one-liners that pepper it, there are moments in it that reminded me of other films and plays Simon has written. In some late moments of intimacy between Hawn and Chase I felt that some of Chase's descriptions of Hawn's little idiosyncrasies actually could have been dialog left over from BAREFOOT IN THE PARK, from scenes between Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. And the unwelcome intrusion of Chase into an organized household resembles the situations in THE ODD COUPLE and THE SUNSHINE BOY, where Oscar has to make room for Felix, and Willie Clark has to reunite with Al Lewis.<br /><br />There are plenty of amusing sections: Chase fighting back fear and hysteria when he is with the kidnapping bank robbers (when he compliments the wording of the bank robbing note, the robber who wrote it thanks him); Hawn's fighting for the underdog legal practice, which results in her having a growing number of clients she is helping to get honest employment for - even in her own household; Gould's judge trying to get to the point of the ridiculous arguments and fact patterns that first Hawn and later Grodin put into his court; Grizzard's governor looking forward to dinner with his future attorney general, and his favorite dish, only to find the state's number one criminal is serving it to him. All in all it is an entertaining film. But it is not as concentrated and unified a script as FOUL PLAY was. You will enjoy the film, but FOUL PLAY is somewhat more memorable.",unsup

Chase plays it dry and Hawn is a loose pin, but it's the crackling chemistry between them that really works wonders and the third party of Charles Grodin caps it off nicely. And not forgetting the ever reliable T.K Carter ('Southern Comfort', 'The Thing' and 'Runaway Train') who drops in with an amusing performance.<br /><br />Director Jay Sandrich is responsible for a lot TV shows and TV movies, but his crack at a feature length film displays bounce with the comical bravura and timing. The witty script (magnificently penned by Neil Simon) is well placed with its gags that it never out stays its welcome, but maybe it gets lost amongst its laconic talky spots. The eventual kayos that occurs is rather structured in its episodic layouts that come and go, but it's done in a wry style than intentional clumsiness even throwing some slapstick moments aside.<br /><br />A highly entertaining comedy enterprise by two stars who were at their peaks.",unsup

I think there are only a couple of films where Chevy Chase & Goldie Hawn worked together in as good a situation as they did here. Too bad it didn't happen more often as their chemistry in this one is really great.<br /><br />Now, if only a moose & squirrel showed up in the film & scared old Ira out of his wits, this one can only get funnier.

There are no slow spots, flat jokes or flopped sight gags anywhere throughout and what can one say about Grodin? He's great, the modern day ""stone-face"" scores yet again!<br /><br />The lines are endlessly quotable and some are downright classic.

Yvonne Wilder steals the show as the house-keeper Aurora, who runs a tight ship amid all the confusion of the pack of dogs always running around; She speaks her mind yelling things ""under her breath"". It isn't any Shakespeare, but its all around fun for all ages, and has a clever screenplay. Charles Grodin is the dour, serious husband who is trying to hold his position as Husband. The chemistry between Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn is amazing, and you can sense the conflict that the married Goldie Hawn feels as she tries to avoid falling back in love with Chevy Chase.

It is not entirely faithful, i.e. Operation Bareback (which I would have enjoyed) was forgone, probably due to the mass nudity that it would entail. The love interest, the storyline and the characters were very close to the novel. Some criticize it as a ripoff of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but the novel actually pre-dates that work, so who copied from whom? The scope of the movie was scaled back and little mention was made of landings and conflicts in other countries, but this may be due to editing exigencies. The aliens are suitably creepy as my wife will agree, as she still refuses to watch it again, and it manages without the gore of many similar movies, although it is rather violent.<br /><br />Compared to another recent Heinlein adaptation, Starship Troopers, this film was much truer to the author's original work and is a thrilling and thoughtful treat.

And the guy offering hors d'oeuvres to Mr. Peru, just for keeping a straight face.<br /><br />The Italian accents are uniformly awful, I'll admit, and the gags are sometimes dopey. But they're funny dopey, not painful dopey. If you're not too sophisticated to enjoy a simply enjoyable movie, rent this movie or pick it up for $5 at Half Price Books like we did.

You won't. If you were in the theater, you'd probably walk out. Since you'll probably watch this at home, expect to walk out of your house, because the whole thing will be poisoned.<br /><br />The first poorly acted scene with legendary starlet Bo Derek was just a harbinger of things to come. Flailing confusion followed for the next 75 minutes, which seemed a stretched out version of a 45 minute script.<br /><br />The acting never convinced you of anything but the effect of weak directing. It was as if director Perry Blake was too afraid to tell his actors what to do. Few of them turned in a scene that didn't seem like a first take. The cameras just kept rolling anyway, perhaps trying to save money on film by not re-shooting anything.<br /><br />The costume-based jokes all fall flat in seconds. When a character is more creepy and awkward than funny, there's a problem. On a scale of 1 to 10, one being amusing and ten being creepy, the ""Turtle Guy"" scene was the proverbial 11. Note to all involved: A guy saying ""turtle"" in a weird sheepish voice isn't funny, and it certainly isn't funny when you've had him repeat it 20 times within five minutes as the only attempted joke in the entire scene.<br /><br />If the only comic relief next to the performance of confused, awkward ""straight man"" Jennifer Esposito is a guy repeating the same line over and over again, you're scraping the wood off the bottom of the laugh barrel. There's just nothing there to find remotely amusing. All the audience feels is pity for everyone involved in the movie, including themselves.<br /><br />That type of unnerving awkwardness repeats over and over again throughout the movie, halted only briefly by comedic gems left completely unexplored like the ""Classmates.com"" profile in which the evil villain (played by Brent Spiner, who once again had nothing to work with) gives away his entire plan.<br /><br />What you get is an unfunny, unbearable view of Dana Carvey and many of his cast mates committing career suicide right in front of you. If you want to watch a movie that makes you feel joy, laughter, intrigue, and other positive feelings, watch something else. If you want to ride a roller-coaster of unrequited emotion as you hope over and over again that Dana Carvey is funny for his own sake, only to be let down over and over again until you push the stop button, this one's for you.

Heinlein novel, with the venerable Donald Sutherland in one of the lead roles, and with alien invasion the subject matter, this should have been at least a seven star Science Fiction film. As Sci-Fi goes, the superior ones focus more on futuristic and/or scientific concepts, with action and/or special effects adding to the spectacle. That is why films like the Star Wars saga really aren't Sci-Fi, but action/adventure first (and in the case of Star Wars, fantasy) and science fiction second at best. This film does delve into the biology and culture of the aliens, but just barely. Mostly it focuses on hokey special effects and a few watered-down action scenes to fill up screen time. The aliens themselves are quite realistic and original, a plus for the film. The chemistry between Donald Sutherland as the leader of a secret government agency and his son, played by Eric Thal (an unknown at the time) is actually quite good. In addition, Julie Warner actually does well as the scientist working for Sutherland and of course plays the romantic interest for Sutherland's son. While not a superior actress, she performs adequately, although her talents are more suited to television, as it appears this movie was. While most will think, as I did, while reading the plot synopsis of the film that it is a rip-off of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (Sutherland starred in the remake of this film in 1978), the actual book was published in 1951, prior to the original film as well as the novel written by Jack Finney.

A word of advice for those who haven't seen ""The Master of Disguise"": for those of you - like me - who loved Dana Carvey's impressions and comedy on SNL, remember him that way. I thought he was in the top 5 SNL cast members ever, and it was always a mystery to me why Adam Sandler & Chris Rock (fair-to-middling SNL alumni IMO) became stars while some of the true comedic geniuses like Phil Hartman and Dana Carvey didn't get top roles. In Mr. Carvey's case, the mistake of being in this film show that making good choices is of paramount importance to those aspiring to move on to the big screen. The movie is never funny and isn't even ""bad"" good. It just stinks. He plays a character named ""Pistachio Disguisey"". COME ON - my 5-year-old nephew could come up with a wittier name, and believe me, he wouldn't laugh at even the most infantile jokes in this flick. I defy any adult to even crack a smile. If you do, you must be on acid. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!",unsup

This movie was'nt funny , just inane , at one point a character has a disguise like grass with a cow poo for a face . The jokes and situations were weak and when it finished we were saying "" what the hell was that all about "" Sorry to say we found this a big waste of time , but my workmate told me her boyfriend really likes this movie , so I guess you should watch it and judge for yourselves .",unsup

10775_0,"Is that there are people that have a high enough IQ to write a review, and actually liked it. One of the worst films of all time. I have not been a Carvey fan after SNL but you have to expect more from a guy with his comedic timing and characterization ability. I can only imagine how he must have felt when this wrapped and he looked at the finished product. I can only assume he missed the daily's as any reasonable person would have quit after the first day. That's how bad the film is. There isn't a single scene that isn't embarrassing. The characters are absurd, the acting atrocious, the plot non existent. No question, this movie is a wonderful example of why IMDb should allow zero stars for their reviews. It absolutely doesn't rate the one star I gave it. The idea that people would recommend this movie with a straight face only goes to show what kind of trouble the population at large is really in. I have to think the caretakers of those who enjoyed the movie wrote the review for them because nobody with a IQ higher than 50 could have thought anything other than this movie was an incredible disaster.",unsup
10776_0,"Simply put, this movie was so infantile it really was rather annoying. I normally love Dana Carvey. He was great in both ""Wayne's World"" movies, he was one of the reasons ""Saturday Night Live"" became funny again, he's always been hilarious when he's guest hosted SNL in later years, and his stand-up comedy, most especially his 1995 HBO special that aired frequently on Comedy Central, is uproariously funny.<br /><br />For those reasons, I really wanted Dana Carvey to make a big screen comeback and have a movie career as illustrious as Mike Myers'. However, I hope he gets another chance in the next few years with a supporting role in a better movie, because ""The Master of Disguise"" is so much of a disappointment I feel embarrassed for Dana Carvey.<br /><br />That's not to say that Dana Carvey doesn't have some moments of brilliance. His Al Pacino and George W. Bush imitations are both funny and on target, but everything else from his annoying Italian accent to his basic dialogue to his name (Come on, Pistachio?) bury those funny moments like a huge pile of rubble and scrap metal. This movie isn't like a car crash: it's like a wrecker carrying away the aftermath of the crash to the dump, and it's much easier to look away from that scene.<br /><br />Even though James Brolin, Harold Gould, and Jennifer Esposito obviously did their best with what was given to them, the movie as a whole just suffered. You can't blame them for not trying though. Highly anticipated movies like this usually suffer from a weak script, a disappointing ending, or the primary cast being so eclipsed by their fame and reputation that they show up to shoot drunk and stoned, and their jadedness shows through the screen. Fortunately, the latter wasn't true for this movie, but it still needed some major work.<br /><br />Since this movie bombed critically and commercially, Dana Carvey hasn't made any public appearances that I know of either in movies or on TV. I have the feeling, however, that the next project he works on, whatever it may be, will truly be a big comeback for him. Ellen Degenerous, Ben Affleck, and Woody Allen are among those who have made noteworthy and surprising comebacks during this decade so far, and Dana Carvey has the potential to do the same.",unsup
10777_0,"For my purposes, this title gets a 8 out of 10. Five for the movie itself, an extra two points for Mr. Spiner's diamond blue eyes, and one for the set designer who had the presence of mind to arrange Spiner's character's color scheme around them. Everything around ""Devlin Bowman"" is blue and white and the effect is quite striking.<br /><br />The movie is a ninety minute fart joke. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Harold Gould, by far and away, delivers the best overall performance in the movie (such as it is). Casting James Brolin in this movie was a definite stroke of completely ridiculous genius. Austin Wolff is, of course, adorable, and Dana Carvey's particular brand of multiple personality disorder is as entertaining as ever (I got a definite chuckle out of Mr. Peru).<br /><br />Like I said, the movie is a ninety minute fart joke and is quite clearly directed at males between the ages of eight and twelve. If you have a roomful of those kind of people and you'd like them to stop breaking things by playing baseball with the ceiling fan, this movie will at least put them all in one room and occupy them with disgusting noises for about an hour and a half. There's no swearing. The (incredibly) mild ""blue"" content is really tame and based on a cartoony visual gag, as is the ""violence"". It's supposed to be a silly, sight gag based comedy and that's exactly what it is.<br /><br />As for Spiner (you knew I was getting to it); first of all, he's gorgeous. Like I said, the character's entire color scheme is a shade of electric blue that compliments his eyes to the point of being captivating. I was hitting the pause button just because I *had* to look. The jokes are (of course) at his character's expense (he *is* the bad guy, after all), and he, appropriately, rolls out his very best ""smarmy/irritated"" act (the one that stole ""Out To Sea"" right out from under two legends). It's amusing and relatively gentle right up until the climax of the movie, where he hits the ""crazy button"" and doesn't look back. Then it's just plain hilarious. In terms of Spiner-related content, I got exactly what I wanted out of this movie and just a little bit more.<br /><br />By the way, Classmates.com owes Spiner a big, wet kiss (trust me).",unsup
10778_0,"Admittedly, this is a utterly silly movie. However, I laughed my head off at Dana Carvey dressed as a turtle going into a night club, making ""turtle"" noises. It is a movie that perhaps needs a little laughing gas or good companionship to help you slip into its groove. Its humour is reminiscent of the Pink Panther scene, where Dreyfus and Clouseau, stoned on nitrous oxide, laugh at Dreyfus's melting face. It is a vehicle for Carvey to show off a parade of weird accents, mannerisms, and theatrical false teeth.<br /><br />The running joke is watching people react to Carvey, trying to figure out why he is behaving so bizarrely, but somehow intimidated by his insanity.<br /><br />I once read that the best way to get a row of seats to yourself in a plane is simply to chew on a piece of string and let it droop out the corner of your mouth.<br /><br />Forget you are a film critic.

In fact, I found the premise genuinely creepy, the effects highly believable, and the presence of Donald Sutherland to be a masterful touch. It may not go down in the all-time pantheon of ""greatest sci-horror films"" ever, but if it was playing on HBO I wouldn't change the channel.

He worked great when his movies stayed within the 15-30 demographic.<br /><br />Then he destroyed his career with the Master of Disguise.<br /><br />This 'comedy' was so bad that it made me feel terrible just for watching it. I was embarrassed to be watching this movie in public. There's nothing funny about openly pitying an actor as you watch him force the run time to 80 minutes with jokes so flat they don't even register above the painfully boring dialog.<br /><br />""Painful"" is a good way to describe this movie. Nothing works. Sometimes you can't even tell when the jokes had happened. That's how bad they were. I watched this with my brother and found myself asking ""was that supposed to be a joke?"" I guess so, because it happened over and over again.<br /><br />I don't find his fake Italian accent as annoying as many of the reviewers, but how the hell is repeating the word ""turtle"" over and over again while dressed in a turtle suit to get into a turtle club supposed to be funny, let alone plausible in the plot? Was everybody involved with the film consistently drunk as this was being made? Surely somebody must have said something like ""Guys, this really sucks. Lets burn it and never speak of it again.""

Yes, this movie doesn't make any sense but that's why its a silly movie but it sure makes you laugh and that's the reason why we watch a comedy. By the way, not many great comedy movies make sense or adhere to logic all the time because they need not do that, they are just suppose to be funny.

10782_0,"But before you chalk this up to being just the ramblings of a madman, a child or both, I would like to assure you that I am a 24 year old male with a broad sense of humor. I can't believe The Master of Disguise got such harsh reviews. It opened in Denmark nearly a year after it did in America so I had plenty of opportunities to read the bad reviews. But I decided to ignore them and to form my own opinion. I went to see it with my sister and I genuinely liked it. Word must have got around, because we were the only ones there, but on the other hand it was one of the smaller theaters in a multiplex cinema on a workday. Actually it added to the whole experience because we could laugh as loud as we wanted. And boy, did we laugh. There were so many funny scenes like The Turtle bit and the all too specific pop-up book, not to mention the slapping dummy. I especially enjoyed the references to other movies like when Grandfather Disguisey shows up Father Merrin style or when Pistachio shows up at Bowman's party disguised as Tony Montana. Another thing I liked was the cameos by for instance Bo Derek. I thought it was a great movie. The characters were both well cast and acted, furthermore I found that all the jokes were well carried out and none of them fell flat, not even Devlin Bowman's flatulence. It's nearly impossible to miss with a good fart joke.<br /><br />What can I say? Sometimes you just can't rely on critics. I can't wait to see Malibu's Most Wanted. I know it too got some harsh reviews but I don't care. I've seen the trailer and it looks good to me. I'm going. Even if it doesn't open in the Danish theaters.",unsup

Don't waste your time, watch something else.<br /><br />Elements of the plot that attempt to keep the movie going for the first hour are immature and crude.

Adults, you will find nothing here that's amusing, unless you're really into totally lame, flat jokes. Kids, you will neither find anything amusing in the movie, as the actors are not funny enough to entice any one of any age.

It uses the universal visual language of cinema to tell a tale of secret desires, control, manipulation, death and rebirth. Good and evil are not portrayed as opposing values, but as the reflection of each other, bouncing over Matthew Saliba's carefully developed characters. For the viewer, the film feels like it's 10 minutes long. If I judge by its reception at the Fantasia International Film Festival, film goers love it. Matthew Saliba is a talented filmmaker and I hope he will continue exploring symbolism and metaphors in cinema and continue to develop his unique style. His blend of personal, yet universal issues and crude (in your face) treatment with wild, creative imagination is not ordinary fare. This makes him an extraordinary filmmaker.",unsup

I'm looking forward to seeing what Matthew Saliba will do next - perhaps with Super 16 or even 35mm (and possibly lip-sync!) The lighting for Pandora's Paradox was really quite remarkable, and the overall visual style and mood it produced was fantastic! Actually, I think the lack of lip-sync worked well, as I can't imagine what these characters could possibly say to each other amidst such bizarre behavior, in which their actions speak far more than words. There's certainly lots of psychological material there to sink one's teeth into (as it were), and come up with a variety of explanations, but the central theme is pretty strong and the message comes through clearly without hitting you over the head.",unsup
10793_0,"A horror film that you need a psychology degree to appreciate??? Sure, it wouldn't hurt, if you're looking to gain a deeper understanding of the subtle nuances of this almost half hour assault on the brain, but it's not necessary. Many of the themes expressed are basic human emotions and fears, but when forced to confront these demons of human experience is where the real horror lies. It may take a few viewings to really grasp just what Matthew Saliba has to say, but the knowledge he imparts is well worth your time, if you can make sense of it.<br /><br />When a woman gives birth to a giant severed thumb/toe creature in a room full of bloody weapons, you know you've really stepped into something bizarre. And when the father of the thumb-kin accidentally hatches it by pouring milk over its cuticle, you truly know that there is no turning back. The child, now seemingly fully grown into a teenager, brings his mom the thumb cocoon, which she lovingly turns into soup, before helping the boy's father to perform some kind of Frankensteinesque experiment. The doctor makes an appearance next, feeble assistants who aren't quite human in tow, all leading up to some strange ass visuals including a meatloaf mask, a pick axe wig splitting, and a return to the womb.<br /><br />As I said above, a fluent knowledge of Freud and Jung isn't compulsory to enjoy the imagery, but it really does help when trying to ascertain the underlying story that makes up the crux of Pandora's Paradox. We are handed everything from Oedipal complex to matricide, and more psychoanalysis than an FBI profile of a serial killer. If these kinds of things excite you, then by all means, dive in and enjoy, but if you're looking for a more straightforward horror flick, this might be a little too cerebral for you. If you happen to fall into the latter category, I'd suggest dusting off your David Cronenberg DVDs and watching those for the umpteenth time.",unsup

Unfortunately Matthew Saliba's Pandora's Paradox is not one of these films. I happened to catch this short film at a New York film festival and I was far from entertained. Clocking in at about twenty minutes this film was a long watch and I found myself looking at the clock several times. This to me seems like the easy way to make a film nowadays, throw a bunch of random images on the screen, add some cheesy colored lighting, and toss in some annoying sound and voila end of the semester film project. What happened to constructing a well written screenplay? fully fleshed out characters? or even creating something original. The story has something to do with a boy, some doctors, a weird old guy with a phallic object on his underwear and a giant toe which somehow all leads to the main character and his withdrawal from life. The acting seemed like it was way better than your typical student film but it was hard to tell when the parts we're reduced to annoying laughter and screaming. Basically this film did nothing but annoy me and I can't really even think of a reason to recommend it.

There is no real substance here. Notice that the previous reviewer, Rick Hancox, claims that there is a ""strong message"" though he neglects to mention what that may be.

10796_0,"Despite the fact that I worked as DP/Camera Op on the film, it was still quite a shock to see the end result and the end result is definitely weird. Although the story may not appear to make a whole lot of sense, Matt always seemed to have a very detailed vision of what he wanted to put down on film. So even though many of the images may seem random, everything from the toe to the lighting was very thought out.<br /><br />When I step back and watch the film as a whole (and not focus on the lighting or camera movements) there are things I like and dislike.<br /><br />Once you get past the overall absurdity of the film, you can actually link the images to real life and use them as a kind of metaphor. From there, a story does begin to emerge albeit shaded in the bizarre. (But it's an experimental horror movie so cmon!) <br /><br />The acting is great. A little over the top and sometimes forced (which should be expected) but very solid. Esp. the little kid who I'm sure many of you would be surprised to learn had never acted prior to this film.<br /><br />Matt'direction is energized and loaded with style. He trusts his actors and knows when to let them steal the scene and not the camera, SFX etc. Even lighting. At the same time there is somewhat of a lack of focus in the films' presentation(directing, editing). Come end time, the film is far too long and could have benefited from having at least 7 minutes axed.<br /><br />The sound for me was the biggest problem. It was too amateurish and hokey and didn't match the overall dark yet slick feel of the film. The no lip sync was OK, but the random and poorly dubbed sound effects coupled with the tacky Mario Bros. music became a distraction. Oh well.<br /><br />The lighting of course was great but the direction for a lot of it came from Matt's weird head. I boned up on some Itallian horror to help with getting the feel right, making sure I could translate what Matt had on paper onto film.<br /><br />Overall, Pandora's Paradox is a solid yet bizarre film combining Lynch and Argento with Matt's own twisted ideas. Whether or not you enjoy the movie (and a lot of people will not)I feel that you can't deny the production value of the film coupled with the fact that at the very least it's crazzzzy eye candy.<br /><br />2rights",unsup
10797_0,"I have seen this short twice and both times I was bowled over by the gorgeous computer-generated animation. Clearly, Pixar is THE studio that sets the animation standard. However, I think this film has a strike against it from the outset and that is because the CARS characters aren't as endearing or timeless as many of the other Pixar creations. They lack the ""cuddly factor"" or depth of some of the other characters and so, at least to me, it doesn't stack well with the MONSTERS, INC., UP!, RATATOUILLE or INCREDIBLES (among others).<br /><br />As for the short, it's about Mater and how cowardly he is.

It didn't come, and hadn't come when I walked out almost an hour later. The technology alone was enough to make any modern film goer cringe. You could actually see the blue line between the 2 Jackies!! All I can say is that Jackie Chan must have signed and released the rights to this film long long ago! I will go and see the next Jackie Chan film but only AFTER checking the production date! Poor Jackie!",unsup
107_0,"The movie is a bit sloppy from a technical standpoint, but it remains the only movie to make me literally laugh myself sick. The Farrelly brothers owe a huge debt to Robert Klane's mining of the twisted humor genre. For years, this was my video holy grail. Finally, it occurred to me that it probably showed up from time to time on the Fox Movie Channel; so, not having it on my cable system, I started buying the monthly satellite programming guides, and when it came up in the rotation on FMC, I had a friend tape it for me. A simple DVD release will not be adequate. This needs the full Special Edition treatment. And oh, how I hope there are outtakes.",unsup
10800_0,"A bunch of horny teens having a hot weekend at an isolated cabin get viciously attacked by a werewolf. The group wussy and his mechanic gal-pal soon learn that finding the identity of the beastly perp may lead to answers that hit a little too close for comfort. Meh. I know this one has its fans, but I couldn't get into it. I felt like I was watching a mash-up of a bad ""Sci-Fi Original"" with The OC or some such wretched teen show. There's loads of ridiculous dialogue (""Shut up and put your clothes on!"" being a highlight), incredibly bad CGI, and a villain that spews one-liners like Freddy Kreuger (but less funny.) I thought it was borderline unwatchable.",unsup
10801_0,"Derek(Trevor Duke)really wants to make a fraternity so he gets a duplicate key made for his step-father's cabin and allows some college students(two dudes and their chicks)to hang out there to booze and have sex. He really doesn't fit in with them and begs a biker chick/female mechanic Sam(metal-faced Kimberly J Brown), a friend from high school he carries a torch for, to come with him. That night, when they finally make it to the cabin, all but Derek and Sam are ripped apart by a blood-thirsty, werewolf who can talk human and cracks wise! What's even worse is that Derek finds out his step-dad, Mitch Toblat(Richard Tyson, not the greatest actor but at times, in this role, quite menacing)might very well be the werewolf that attacked the university kids that night. When Uncle Charlie(Christopher Shyer)tells Derek about how his father REALLY died(he was told by mama that he perished in a ""hunting accident"", but we see in the opening that it's a massive werewolf), Sam aides him by trying to seduce Mitch so that they can collect DNA samples from his hair..she's able to do so, but it has to be from his nether region! Meanwhile, Derek wishes for his mom to escape a verbally abusive marriage while gaining some guts of his own. When often confronting Mitch, it's clear he's just too weak, both mentally and physically. I mean he's kind of a prissy, puny pretty-boy who depended on the more butch Sam to fight his battles in school(..if you watch this film, they are paired through the screenplay to wind up as a couple, but both look as if they need to come out of the closet..it's kind of a joke in itself). When Mitch wises to their scheming, he'll aim to silence Derek, Sam & Charlie if it means his werewolf secret will remain hidden.<br /><br />At times, this B-movie is pretty decent, but it often shifts gears from serious terror tale to outrageous monster movie. A werewolf tossing quips, forces it anally on one helpless female, doesn't waste possible tattletales in Derek and Sam right away, plus hearing him speak face-to-face with victims seems awfully awkward. Yet, in the middle of the film, it takes a more serious tone. I couldn't really get a grip on where the director wanted to go with it. The werewolf costume, at times, almost drew chuckles from me instead of gasps and the supposed pairing of a feminine, girlish Derek and butch, beer-swilling, foul-mouthed Sam seems quite far-fetched and unreasonable. He's too much of a sissy..she'd chew a guy like him up and spit poor Derek out. And, the idea he'd really stand a chance against Mitch in werewolf form, when he gulps as the human step-dad approaches him is a bit of a stretch as well. And, the kids who get picked off at the end was merely put in the flick so that we could see more fresh meat for the werewolf. I'm sure many will appreciate that, but it rather detracts from the suspenseful show-down between Derek and Mitch quite a bit. The flick really is quite a howler.",unsup

10803_0,"On the list of werewolf movies, ""Big Bad Wolf"" ranks pretty low but still manages to stay above ""Arizona Werewolf."" I encourage you to get to a Redbox and rent this movie but don't blow $3.50 at Hastings for it.<br /><br />Richard Tyson brings a great presence to the film but overshadows the two leads (Trevor Duke & Kimberly Brown). Duke obviously couldn't hang with Tyson in their scenes together and looked genuinely intimidated but not in a good way. One wonders if Tyson didn't push him around off camera as well. Brown's character was just wrong, wrong and pointless and she and Duke didn't have anything between them chemistry wise. After the initial encounter with the beast I was in denial that Duke was the hero of the movie.<br /><br />At any rate, the movie was entertaining and you gotta love the idea of a werewolf that rips your lungs out through your mouth and talks trash while he does it. The extras all made for great werewolf chow but I wish the finale had let us see a bit more kills. They loaded up the scenes with wolf fodder and we only got to see two gory deaths while the rest were implied. That's okay though, I laughed, I said ""Ewwww"" out loud and at the end of the film I didn't feel ripped off.<br /><br />P.S. Kudos to the producers for the extras on the DVD. Films like this don't usually get that kind of treatment.",unsup
10804_0,"I hated this, it reminded me of some made for TV horror movie, it was that bad. The makeup for the creature was super cheap looking and the werewolf jokes were stupid and unfunny. This movie failed in both departments of horror and comedy. Big Bad Wolf made me yearn for a true B class horror movie which would have been a big step up for this mess, it was like a lousy TV movie that looked like it was made on the cheap in a couple of days. The actors were obviously there for a paycheck and to get through it as quickly as possible. Who can blame them, certainly no one who read the script beforehand. The special effects were lame, the plot absurd, with no suspense or one decent scare. As I was watching it what came to mind was this would be a good candidate for that show where they would lampoon the worst science fiction and horror movies made. At least then this movie would have some entertainment value. Barring that Big Bad Wolf is another example of low-grade movie making in the horror genre.",unsup
10805_0,"Big Bad Wolf starts in Cameroon as brothers Charlie (Christopher Shyer) & Scott Cowley (Andrew Bowen) are on a big game hunt, however the hunters become the hunted as a big Werewolf like creature kills Scott... Jump forward 'Seven Years Later' in the US & Scott's widow Gwen (Sarah Aldrich) has married Mitch (Richard Tyson), Scott's son Derek (Trevor Duke) & Mitch don't get on & in order to impress some school mates he steals the keys to his stepfather's isolated log cabin so they can have a party there. Unfortunately while there they are attacked by the same Werewolf creature that killed Scott, only Derek & his friend Sam (Kimberly J. Brown) escape alive. Hearing about the attack Derek's uncle Charlie reveals his suspicions that Mitch is the Werewolf & that they have to kill him once & for all...<br /><br />Written, produced & directed Lance W. Dreesen I am in two minds about Big Bad Wolf. Now, I am not a fan of low budget straight-to-DVD horror films shot on a camcorder & edited on a PC but this one actually started off quite well. The opening twenty odd minutes features some gore, a Werewolf, some nudity & a massacre but then it slows down to a snail's pace & becomes incredibly predictable as it goes around in circles to pad the running time out. The biggest problem is that we, the audience that is, are always fully aware of who the Werewolf is so there's no mystery or intrigue element & watching Charlie, Derek & Sam trying to figure it out is rather tedious & one might say unnecessary as we already know. We don't see the Werewolf for ages as we have to sit through several sub soap opera melodramatic sub plots. The way that Mitch killed Scott so he could marry Gwen is a good case in point, however if that was the case why does Mitch treat her so badly? Why all the rows? Why the obvious hate between the two? It just renders the plot point rather pointless in my opinion. The character's aren't great & include a pointless group of students who have no purpose other than to get killed at the end although I did quite like Sam as her character had some attitude & was pretty spunky & there is no explanation given as to why or how Mitch became a Werewolf. The film ends much the same way as it starts with teenage kids getting killed in the same log cabin & like the start only Derek & Sam survive.<br /><br />Director Dreesen does alright here, the film looks reasonably good without ever being outstanding. There are obvious references to other (better) horror films including a log cabin straight from The Evil Dead (1982). The Werewolf creature looks OK but the CGI computer transformation scene looks rubbish. Unlike most Werewolf films the Werewolf in Big Bad Wolf can actually talk & is a right Freddy Krueger type as it spouts horribly unfunny one-liners as it kills people, mostly teenagers. This is one aspect of Big Bad Wolf that I really didn't like at all, the Werewolf mask's mouth doesn't move properly either so besides sounding silly it looks it. There are one or two decent gore scenes here, legs are ripped off, there are decapitated head with one shown being twisted off, there are guts, there's blood splatter, the Werewolf claws someone's throat & a scene in which the Werewolf rips a guy's head in half. There is also a short scene which implies the Werewolf has raped a teenage girl.<br /><br />Technically the film is good enough, it's no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's reasonably well made considering the budget must have been pretty low. The acting isn't going to win anyone any awards but I have seen worse. David Naughton & Clint Howard make small cameos.<br /><br />Big Bad Wolf is an OK way to pass 90 odd minutes, I can't say that I overly liked it because of the talking Werewolf & an all to predictable & obvious plot which feels padded. Could have been but it could have been better, worth a watch if your a Werewolf fan but there are much better horror films out there.",unsup
10806_0,"I usually rave about crappy movies in my reviews, but this one disturbed me more than most others. Not because of the violence, which was as over the top as one might expect, but because of the implication that sexual violence against women is somehow humorous. Unlike other horror movies with a high boob and body count, the writer of this movie (Lance W. Dreesen) never misses an opportunity to completely degrade and dehumanize the female characters. A disturbing, repeated theme is how sexual violence perpetrated against women is mocked by a ""joke"" from the werewolf character. For instance, one of the throwaway sorority girls in the opening sequence is revealed to be a virgin; this seemingly unnecessary plot thread is brought to fruition after she is raped by the werewolf before her throat is ripped out during the rape. After this despicable act, the werewolf taunts her boyfriend about the rape, remarking, ""she ain't a virgin anymore!"" Another example: the lead female character, Sam, is revealed to be in love with the lead male character Derek. This seemingly innocent plot thread is exploited when she is forced to perform oral sex on Derek's evil step-dad. Of course, evil step-dad tells Derek all about it and remarks, ""you ain't tapped that yet?"" Don't let my description of these acts of sexual violence make you think that the acts are graphically depicted. For the most part, the sex is implied rather than revealed, but the characters discuss sex in a graphic way. I suppose it's all meant to reveal the main point of the movie, namely answering the question: ""what would happen if an evil s.o.b. was a werewolf?"" This movie certainly answers that question again and again, probably well beyond most viewers' willingness to watch it all.<br /><br />In summation, there's so much ugliness in this movie that it's hard to find a bright spot. The concept of a talking, taunting werewolf is interesting, but I would have liked to see it utilized in a manner different from that described above. Kimberly J. Brown is really excellent as Sam and Trevor Duke does a good job as wimpy Derek. Richard Tyson does his best Jack Nicholson impersonation as Mitchell Toblat (""Talbot"" spelled backwards), which really isn't much of a complement. I really hope that ""Big, Bad Wolf"" is the first and last movie made with this cast of characters. I dread seeing what writer Lance W. Dreesen could come up with to try to top the sexual violence and hatred present in this movie.",unsup
10807_0,"After a few excellent movies in the eighties (such as An American Werewolf in London and The Howling), the werewolf genre seemed to take a fall in the nineties. Then, movies such as Dog Soldiers and Ginger Snaps came along, making me believe the genre was making a comeback. Then Cursed came along and ruined every hope.<br /><br />Big Bad Wolf has been depicted as a 'B-movie', people warning not to expect too much of it. It's scheduled to be released on DVD in the US in June. Abominable is another movie which was released on DVD and one I'd very much like to see. I'm still waiting for Abominable to come out here (the Netherlands) on DVD but I decided not to wait with Big Bad Wolf (don't worry, if it does come out, I'll buy it).<br /><br />To cut it short, I certainly wasn't disappointed. The movie has a good, gloomy atmosphere one looks for with movies such as this. Also, in my opinion, it takes a certain individual to portray the werewolf in human form, who  basically  can be put into two categories: the sad, cursed victim (like in An American Werewolf), or the sadistic, willing victim (like in The Howling). Richard Tyson plays one hell of a werewolf and his character can definitely be placed under the second category.<br /><br />Not only as a werewolf, but in human form as well, Mitchell Toblat is one nasty character. The werewolf too is somewhat different than we've seen before.<br /><br />Like with many, I had my doubts about a talking werewolf, but I believe it has worked out nicely. In this movie, the werewolf truly is a well sexual predator as well, representing the animal side of human nature, call it ID if you'd like, but it worked out well. Blood, gore and sadism all around nicely done, though, and not too much. The movie also had humour in places; as with An American Werewolf in London, not overly done and well-timed.<br /><br />None of the other cast members annoyed me (most were even likable), unlike several recent werewolf movies. The story has a few nice turns and most of them weren't overly predictable. The ending didn't hold too many surprises and is perhaps even a tad disappointing (sequel, perhaps?) but all in all, this is worth watching.<br /><br />Call it a 'B-movie', but in my opinion (being the werewolf freak that I am), it's a hell of a lot better than Cursed and, yes, I dare say, better than many mainstream horror movies of recent years.",unsup

Next was this overly clichéd werewolf story. but with one catch: It really wasn't that bad. Yes, all elements were there, the characters you knew were gonna get it and in which order and the predictable (no spoiler) door left open for Bigger, Badder Wolf. But the performance from Sam, the change from normal wolf-man to talking, pants wearing creature and a mild subplot of how he came to be. Yes, the movie was bad, but the efforts involved, makes it overall, really not that bad. I've seen a lot worse, a lot worse werewolf movies (see Howling II-XXVII).

10810_0,"Though I wouldn't expect it at all, this was indeed a good movie. It has his problems (the teenagers are annoying as always, the dialoguse have major problems and the werewolf is not done very good), but you can surely pass over. The very good points: 1. The werewolf is quite crazy. He tears apart his victims, he IS a beast. 2. The werewolf is talking! This is ingenious indeed, I never saw it before, and I saw a lot of werewolf movies. You may think at first it is inappropriate, but I assure you the effect overall is very good. 3. There are pleasant nudity scenes, great tits, and the werewolf even rapes one of the teengirls in her perfect ass, in front of her boyfriend. While rather disturbing, the scene is quite good and adds to the story. 4. The atmosphere is nicely done, quite dark, quite 80's and there IS suspense. I am surely recommend the movie as one of the few werewolf movies made good in the last decades, with Ginger Snaps Unleashed and Dog Soldiers being other two examples in the same vein.",unsup
10811_0,"Big Bad Wolf is another in a long line of attempts to make a good werewolf movie. This film tries to give us a slightly different twist. Instead of an all animalistic werewolf we get a werewolf that knows who he is, what hes doing and can shoot a wisecrack back atcha with well...lets just say he tries to be funny.<br /><br />The beginning starts with a hunt in Africa where a group of hunters are attacked by the wisecracking canine. From there we flash forward years later to find out that one of the guys killed had a wife and son who are now being taken care of by one of the guys on the hunt. Said son decides to steal some keys to his step dads cabin only to have most of the beginning cast get slaughtered by the Big Bad One.<br /><br />Thinking no one will believe them they decide to stick to a story about a wild animal killing them until the boys uncle, who was also on the hunting trip begins to come back into his life and confirm with him his worst fears...the killer was a werewolf.<br /><br />BBW tries its best to rise above mediocrity even throwing in some all to brief cameos from horror veterans Clint Howard and David Naughton. It has a nice start to the film but when we get to the story you will have figured out the werewolf way before the middle act and your left with a lot of stupid decision making by some of the characters to pad the running time (ex. DNA testing). We do get an OK conclusion to this one but unfortunately for some viewers it may be too little too late. Also let's also not forget the trash talking, chick raping werewolf who tries to be funny and at times may give you a slight chuckle but more than likely will give you a feeling of uhhhhhhh.<br /><br />In the end we do get a couple of nice gore sequences, a solid turn in from Richard Tyson and Kimberly Brown but in the end it just doesn't make the grade for me. Though the film generally uses prosthetics and blood packs there is one transformation sequence that uses CGI and is not very convincing. Those who are into Freddy Kreuger style killers or just love their Werewolves may want to try this out as a rental as it is worth that. All others can skip this one by.<br /><br />My final score 4/10: Below Average: though I did like that they limited the CGI and that there was some decent gore here and there some of its own hokeyness and middle act bogged this one down enough for me not to recommend this one to the horror masses but the select few who can overlook its shortcomings.",unsup
10812_0,"I am always pleasantly surprised when a movie comes along that I have no expectations about and then it turns out to be a lot better than many other, well-known releases. This was one such movie.<br /><br />The story is very simple (in a nutshell: people attacked by werewolf at remote cabin and surviving teens decide to put an end to the beats), I kept waiting for some twist that didn't appear so don't make that mistake, and the execution isn't going to provide any masterclass for film-makers.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but here, there are some really neat ideas contained within and some great gore moments that will satisfy the horror fans who like their movies awash with blood. This movie is not a non-stop gore-fest but it does sprinkle enough claret around when the action gets hairy. I don't want to spoil anything for newcomers so will just say that I was also greatly surprised by the actual werewolf (some decent makeup used there, shame about the few bad CGI shots that interfere with what could have been some great transformation sequences) and how he behaved, I may be mistaken but there were a few things here that felt pretty original and unique and that's no bad thing.<br /><br />As for the cast, we have the usual collection of disposable teens with two young leads who don't do too badly at all and there are some solid scowls provided by Richard ""best known as the baddie from Kindergarten Cop"" Tyson as he brilliantly menaces those around him and struggles with his own problems. Everyone else is dependable enough though it is a shame that we get the usual ""dumb victim behaviour"" from some characters who should have really known better.<br /><br />Throw in some nice in-jokes for genre fans and a couple of fun cameos, including David ""American Werewolf"" Naughton, and you have quite a treat for fans of the fur 'n' fangs sub-genre. I gave a lot of internal debate to my final score of 7/10 but, what the heck, it's worth it despite it being not much more than disposable fun.<br /><br />See this if you like: The Howling, Ginger Snaps, Werewolf: The Devil's Hound.",unsup
10813_0,Big Bad Wolf is a werewolf film which has the boobs and gore that go great together for a werewolf film like this. The movie was really good for a low budget horror movie and the storyline actually made me want to keep watching it. I actually didn't like the whole werewolf costume but the special effects people made it look realistic and i liked it. If your a fan of Kimberly J. Brown then you'll love her in this movie when shes always cussing up a storm somewhere along the film. The gore was excellent including the boobs and the big body count. I suggest this film to anyone who loves werewolf films with boobs and gore. Even though on the DVD there's not a lot of special features for the film but otherwise the film itself was a great gore fest that keeps you wanting to watch it and besides there's great actors and characters in the film.,unsup

It didn't try to be more than it was supposed to be, but did enjoy itself being all it could be.<br /><br />The werewolf could have done with looking a little more wolf-like in both it's costume and it's mannerisms, and it reminded me of the old wolfman style pre-howling/AWIL.<br /><br />The werewolf had some good lines and worked well with it's attitude overall.<br /><br />The main characters were well acted I thought, and the plot was a nice horror plot that flowed well.<br /><br />Gore, nudity, and naughtiness was all in good supply and didn't feel forced into the story.<br /><br />Don't expect a scary film, or a psychological horror. It is what it is, a fun entertaining film with a few nice ideas and scenes that you don't normally see in films these days.<br /><br />Good potential for a series of films, as the villain and content of the films could work well as such, as long as the production values are maintained.",unsup
10815_0,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's professionally made, well paced, shot and edited with proper actors of decent quality. Richard Tyson as the bad guy step dad/werewolf is actually rather good as is Kimberley Brown as Sam.<br /><br />I thought the story was pretty good and didn't quite go the way I was expecting it to. I imagined it was just another 'teens go to a cabin in the woods and get killed one by one' movie, but it isn't. There is actually a plot and some subtext here. The director says this film is an attempt to use the beast as a metaphor for struggling with addiction and as a representation of the id and the beast within. This is why this werewolf can talk and likes to taunt people, and why he doesn't just kill, but enjoys a spot of rape and torture - and it works just fine in the context of the film. It's also a retelling of the classic mythological story of the son having to confront the father figure to finally become a man. The director acknowledges major story elements owe a lot to the movie The Stepfather (the sheriff is named after that films director, Joe Rubin), and even Shakespeare's Hamlet. The film is also filled with homage's to great movies by Hitchcock, Spielberg and Landis. I won't say what they are, but see if you can spot them or just listen to the interesting and informative commentary.<br /><br />Having said all that, there is still plenty of gratuitous nudity, humour and some nice gore. The make up and CG FX are actually quite good. The wolf is of a decent design and about as well done as you get with standard makeup FX (no animatronics - just man in suit).<br /><br />What I liked most about this film was its take on the werewolf as a representation of the darkest, nastiest and innermost human desires. The villain, while always a pretty nasty guy, had been struggling to control his 'problem' and had actually been quite successful until the daft teens got involved.<br /><br />This is of course a very low budget film. What makes this far superior to similar low budget efforts is that the writer/director had a clear vision of the type of story he wanted to tell and actually spent time on the script and in casting some decent actors.<br /><br />Not brilliant or a classic, but much better than I expected.",unsup
10816_0,"Wimpy Derek Cowley (the likable Trevor Duke), his scrappy tomboy best friend Samantha ""Sam"" Marche (an appealingly spunky performance by Kimberly J. Brown), and four of Derek's obnoxious college classmates go to a remote cabin in the woods owned by Derek's stepfather to party hearty. Things go sour when a vicious werewolf shows up and kills everyone except for Derek and Sam. Derek suspects that the werewolf is really his mean, jerky, abusive step dad Mitchel Toblat (excellently played to the sneering hateful hilt by Richard Tyson). Derek, Sam, and Derek's uncle Charle (the solid Christopher Shyer) all join forces to try to figure out a way to stop Toblat before he kills again. Writer/director Lance W. Dreesen offers a fresh and novel spin on the standard werewolf premise by cleverly blending the more horrific elements with a surprisingly potent and touching domestic drama. The main characters are unexpectedly engaging (Sam in particular is simply awesome, thanks mainly to Brown's winningly sparky portrayal of her), the acting overall acceptable, and the story unfolds at a constant steady pace. Popping up in nice cameos are Clint Howard as grubby hick Fulton Chaney and David Naughton as friendly Sheriff Joe Ruben. The nasty, hulking, wisecracking werewolf makes for a ferocious and frightening monster: the savage beast rips off heads, tears people to pieces, rapes women, and even brutally castrates one poor guy (ouch!). Dana Nu's spooky'n'shuddery score, Stephen Crawford's bright, polished cinematography, and the funky special effects are all uniformly up to par. Moreover, we even get plenty of unflinchingly graphic gore, a pleasing amount of tasty female nudity, a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black twisted humor, and even some soft-core sex. A nifty little sleeper.",unsup
10817_0,"Movie opens with Scott Cowley (Andrew Bowen of Mad TV) on a hunting trip in Cameroon with his brother Charlie. A creature comes out of the jungle and rips Scott's leg off. Charlie can only watch him die.<br /><br />Present day, Scott's wife (Sarah Aldrich of Port Charles) is in a new, unhappy marriage with Scott's friend Mitchell (the under-appreciated Richard Tyson of Two Moon Junction and Hardball), who was also along on the hunting trip years before. Son Derek (Trevor Duke) doesn't get along with stepdad Mitch, and things only get worse when he steals the key to Mitch's secluded cabin and heads out with some frat buddies, their girlfriends, and his pal Samantha (Kim Brown of The Guiding Light). Just when things are heating up at the cabin, a werewolf bursts in and kills everyone but Derek and Sam, who narrowly escape. The two lie about what happened at the cabin to the local sheriff (David Naughton of American Werewolf in London), thinking that no one will believe that a werewolf was responsible for the killings.<br /><br />Derek and Sam have suspicions about Mitch, but don't know how to prove them. Enter Uncle Charlie, who has suspicions of his own ever since the Africa trip. He and the kids set out to prove that Mitch is the werewolf. A clever cat and mouse game ensues, that leads to a final confrontation back at the cabin.<br /><br />This was well written for a relatively low budget horror flick. There is some actual character development and some welcome bits of black humor. The directing and acting are uniformly good, also unusual for a teen oriented film, and the characters are all pretty likable and behave in an intelligent manner to deal with the problem, for the most part. Richard Tyson shines in an admittedly limited role as the sinister stepdad/beast. Trevor Duke as Derek fares less well as the wishy washy, ineffective hero for the bulk of the movie. The gore special effects are more than adequate, though the werewolf transformation sequences leave something to be desired.<br /><br />All in all, Big Bad Wolf moved along at a good pace, was interesting if nothing new or special, and had a good conclusion. Maybe not in the same league as the Universal Wolfman, or Brotherhood of the Wolf, it's still way better than most of the recent crop of werewolf flicks.",unsup
10818_0,"I had some fun times with this film, even though it does not come close to any of the great werewolf pictures. The films strongest points are its gore and the werewolf suit. The kill scenes are gloriously splattery at times and the werewolf looks very cool for a low budget production. I was dubious of the idea of having it talk, but on the other hand hearing a werewolf rattle off cheesy lines and genuinely enjoy getting up to some carnage if fairly novel. No tortured heroics here, this werewolf is just a mean SOB. Richard Tyson plays the role with gusto and it works well albeit in a cheesy way. The film does try to have a bit more of a plot than just a standard teens trapped by a monster opus and it kinda comes off although it makes the film uneven in tone. There is the odd plot hole in there to chuckle at too. Acting wise, the film is OK. The main character and his girl both do pretty well and it is interesting to see a film with such a weak male lead, whose female pal is considerably tougher than he is. Nice traditional role reversal going on there. Sadly, the girl in it is closer to Bree from Neighbours during her goth phase than a convincing looking tough girl but I'll let that slide because it made me laugh. The teenagers at the beginning are appallingly obnoxious and disposable, but happily they are disposed of. The adults mostly do quite well and there is a brief appearance from David Naughton for horror buffs to chuckle at. The films flaws come chiefly from the tone, which varies between gruesome and joyously politically incorrect and a cheesy almost Scooby Doo or Famous Five vibe when the two leads are investigating the werewolf. Also, the ending could have been somewhat better, though it is still perfectly reasonable. All in all, this is a good weekend booze/popcorn film for undemanding werewolf movie fans, with some fine moments and an overall feeling of fun. Good times.",unsup
10819_0,"Typically for me werewolf movies rank right between roots canals and a colonoscopy in terms of desirability. Since they're all based around a centuries-old legend, there's generally not much room for originality without fans crying foul because ""that's not what werewolves do!"" (like werewolves are real and do anything at all). However I decided to give this a shot as it didn't look like your typical werewolf flick and I'm glad I did. The title alone (which is pathetically mundane) made me think it would be another ""so bad it's good"" kind of movie. While it does fall prey to some of the cheesy pitfalls of many horror movies, it is surprisingly entertaining and able to hold your attention throughout. It may also be the first time I've ever seen a werewolf that engages in witty banter with his victims, so props for originality. Don't watch it expecting Oscar material, but enjoy it for what it is...a slightly campy but ultimately very enjoyable horror/comedy. Sit back and let you mind go...preferably with liberal amounts of beer to make it just that much funnier.",unsup

10820_0,"This traditional R rated horror struck a chord with me. After a ton of lame remakes last year, Amityville Horror and Fog, to name a few, you have to scratch your head at decisions being made by the 'suits' in Hollywood. This should not have gone into DVD release without a big screen showing. This is a horror film, the real genre. Not torture. Not watered-down PG-13 crap on a stick.<br /><br />The werewolf genre is so much fun and we have seen so many new interpretations over the years. The schtick of the werewolf lies in not knowing who it is. In this case, you pretty much know from the get-go. The fun lies in how they're going to catch and kill it.<br /><br />The sexy side of Horror has been pushed aside in recent years for torment. Eli Roth can go suck an egg. Tension, shock and screams make a story chilling, and though this movie has its fair share of goopy-gore, it does not dominate the movie. Kinky sex, nudity, lust and some humor along with side-splitting bestiality is what the film is about. This film was made for adults -- not pre-teen, tweens or couch potato sixteen year old boys.<br /><br />Fun! Fun! Fun!<br /><br />Kimberly J. Brown has grown from her Disney efforts into a fine actress, and Trevor Duke does justice to his role. Richard Tyson's delivery of his funnier lines is a hoot. As a bad boy he blends macho sexiness with a sarcastic tone. A real horror film is hard to find these days! So when gems like this come your way, go out of your way to find them.",unsup

Seven years later, his teenage nephew Derek Cowley (Trevor Duke) steals the key of his stepfather's cabin in the isolated Fire Road 13 and travels with four classmates and his friend Sam (Kimberly J.

Sam and Derek survive, and they suspect that his stepfather Mitchell Toblat (Richard Tyson) is a werewolf. When Charlie meets Derek and Sam, they decide to collect evidence to prove that Mitchell is the Beast and kill him, but Mitchell discovers their plot and chases the trio.<br /><br />""Big Bad Wolf"" is a surprisingly good werewolf movie, with gore and black humor. The beginning with teenagers going to an isolated cabin and finding a monster is not original, but the sadistic attack of the werewolf, specially the virgin girl, is hilarious. The situation of Sam collecting DNA sample is also funny. The special effects are great for a B-movie and in the end ""Big Bad Wolf"" is a very entertaining movie and recommended for fans of the genre.

Seven years later we witness a group of friends getting ready to spend a weekend at a remote cabin in the mountains. What should have been a fun getaway turns into a howling night of terror. Bite me! Lance W. Dreesen's lycanthropical fable is quite amusing that doesn't take itself too seriously. The action is tight (when needed) and the gore supplies. Notes should also go to Richard Tyson for playing the sleazy and violent. One can easily see he had fun with his part, but he should definitely work on those one-liners.

10823_0,"At best I was expecting a campy B movie with a little T & A and well, Big Bad Wolf delivered in spades. Derek Cowley steals the key to his step-dad's cabin in an effort to impress the local cool kids and get a little party action on. Derek's friend Sam, a leather wearing tomboy on a motorcycle, on whom he has a not-so-secret crush, is talked into going along. On their way to the cabin the teenagers meet a local who warns them to stay away from the cabin but of course the warning is unheeded. It doesn't take long before animal passions are running wild and I don't just mean the sex crazed teenagers.<br /><br />Once the initial action and gore is over, something unusual for a direct to video movie happened... an interesting and engaging story broke out about Derek's abusive step-dad, Mitchell, the effect on his mother, his relationship with Sam and the truth about his father's death. A visit from Uncle Charley leads Sam into a situation that jeopardizes her relationship with Derek while uncovering the truth about Mitchell and putting all their lives in danger. Don't get me wrong, you won't see this picture mentioned at the Oscars, but the acting and direction are competently done and the special effects are really fantastic. Even more amazing when you learn what a short time-span they had to put everything together and learn their roles. Just because some of you will want to know... the girls are cute and all but one have real breasts.<br /><br />I would recommend this highly to fans of campy horror like Feast, Slither and Shaun of the Dead.

If you want a serious well made movie which this one is grafted from,Deliverance is the Gold Standard and Southern Comfort comes in a close second.

There they encounter a bunch of aggressive and large-scale poachers that don't really appreciate strangers trespassing their business. After a couple of banal showdowns follows a truly violent and merciless hunting contest that'll demand many lives! This rather unknown and underrated 80's exploitation movie opens rather slow and ordinary, with redundant speeches about manhood and the art of deer-hunting, but the exciting and genuinely suspenseful hunting sequences during the last half hour widely make up for this. This cool 80's gem has perhaps stolen its storyline and most essential moments from classic blockbusters like ""Deliverance"" and ""the Deer Hunter"", but the raw violence and effective shocks are director Hughes' very own merit. The film contains a couple of very graphic make-up effects, like a stabbing through the neck and a very eerie close-up shotgun killing. Many 80's horror movies feature undistinguished (to say the least) Southern folks as unhinged killers and the cast members of ""Hunter's Blood"" definitely belong to the most successfully menacing Rednecks ever. The filming locations are very impressive and even the photography is surprisingly professional. Keep also an eye open for Billy Bob Thornton in a very small role as background redneck.

1082_0,"I've had my fair share of experience with Jackie Chan films, and have come to learn that the stories in his movies do not make or break them. Rather, they're merely a backdrop upon which countless hand-to-hand fights and slapstick humor are placed, and while they're not necessarily thought-provoking, they are by no means a waste of time to individuals who enjoy more intellectual entertainment.<br /><br />But with ""Twin Dragons,"" it appears as though the story did indeed destroy the movie, to the point where even the action scenes couldn't salvage the film from its inherent ennui.<br /><br />The film's worst traits are perhaps its predictability and repetition. For example, in the beginning we are introduced to the two single elements which will play out implacably for the remainder of the film: confusion in regards to which of the twins is who, and how when one of the twins performs one action, the other is psychically affected and carries it out as well. The film apparently thrives on this to the point where it becomes tiresome after about half an hour, and the manner in which it does it leads one to seriously question the mental capacity of the individuals involved. Never in a movie have I seen women portrayed to be such imbeciles.<br /><br />A couple of the action scenes are worth mention, but the unfortunate aspect of the matter is that unless one watches them separately from the rest of the film, there really isn't much to attract attention. That is, by the time that we have been subjected to the asininity of all the supporting characters in the dialogue sections of the film, we really do not want to see them partake in the fights--and more than once I found myself wishing that the screenwriters had done away with these characters earlier in the story so as to not involve them in any but one or two of the action sequences.<br /><br />For the casual movie watcher, I would consider this to be poison--stay away at any cost, even if you're paid to watch this film. Die-hard Jackie Chan fans may enjoy a couple of scenes, which display a little wit as to how to incorporate Chan's natural charm into the eccentricity of the situations, and some of the stunts are somewhat impressing, though nowhere near the caliber of some of those that he has performed in the latter half of the '90s.",unsup
10830_0,"Hunter's Blood is one of those little-known gems that some of us are lucky enough to have in our video collections. The story centers around five buddies who trek out to the Arkansas wilderness (actually filmed in California) to hunt deer. Game wardens warn them of a murderous gang of poachers in the area, but naturally our heroes disregard the warnings and set up camp. Sure enough, they eventually run into these poachers and several gun battles erupt.<br /><br />This film was clearly inspired by Deliverance, as so many other films about the outdoors are. With Hunter's Blood, the emphasis is on action rather than characterization or drama. That said, there are still plenty of tense moments along the way as the action unfolds.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the strongest things about this film is the collection of colorful characters who make up the poacher clan. There are plenty of creepy looking individuals among them who you will know doubt recognize from other films. Keep a close eye out for Billy Bob Thornton as he gets thrown from the back of a pick-up truck that takes a sharp turn too quickly.<br /><br />Lots of blood and gore. You will need a strong stomach for a few of the scenes.<br /><br />The film isn't too long and the conclusion is quite satisfying. This film is definitely worth a look if you can find a copy.

There is another interesting, demented performance from none other than Billy Drago. For these two reasons alone, ""Hunter's Blood"" should be a keeper. The added bonus is that the movie is actually entertaining. Somewhat talky in the beginning, it gradually builds toward a very satisfying hunted in the woods movie experience. Given that it has a 1987 release date, the movie holds up well, since there is little in the Arkansas outback, other than the Bronco, to indicate a 20 year old production. - MERK",unsup

Five 'city boys', on a hunting trip in the wilds of Arkansas, end up being hunted themselves after running into a group of inbred poachers who don't take too kindly to strangersespecially Yankees.<br /><br />All right, Hunter's Blood may not be all that original, utilising the standard 'backwoods' plot line that has served so many films well in the past (and since). But with a pretty solid cast (including Sam Bottoms, Clu Galager, and Ken Swofford), well paced direction, great dialogue, and some juicy gore, it still manages to be a gripping experience.<br /><br />Director Robert C. Hughes doesn't rush proceedings, taking time to carefully develop his characters before the killing begins. We get to see how the hunters interact with each other, and develop an understanding of their personalities. None of the men are portrayed as saints: even Bottoms' nice-guy intern doctor, David Rand, has a laugh at a barmaid's expense (when the boys stop at a bar to stock up on brews).<br /><br />Of course, even though the group unwisely mock the locals, they don't quite deserve what happens to them once they begin their hunting trip proper.<br /><br />The unsavoury poachers soon make their presence known, interrupting the guys at their campsite and causing trouble, until tough old-timer Mason (Galager) sends them packing. Mason also gets in a spot of bother when the hunters accidentally stumble upon the poachers at work, and gets in a vicious scrap with Snake, a slimy looking redneck played by Billy Drago.<br /><br />Fortunately, as things start to get really nasty, a pair of cops on horseback turn up and arrest the back-woods scum, handcuffing them together and leading them away. However, the bad guys soon manage to escape (after their kin ambush and kill the lawmen) and set out to teach the interferin' city boys a lesson.<br /><br />From here-on in, things get very nasty. The hunters stumble upon the gruesome remains of the cops (a carved up corpse and a severed head), and realise that they are in deep trouble. Their hunting trip has turned into a fight for survival.<br /><br />What follows is a tense, action packed slice of survivalist cinema that delivers plenty of nice 'n' nasty scenes of violence (including a great shotgun blast to the face), which is only weakened slightly by opting to have David's pretty wife Melanie (Kim Delaney) turn up to join in the 'fun' (a rather unbelievable, unnecessary and unwelcome plot turn, in my opinion).<br /><br />7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",unsup

10838_0,"I bought this game for XBox 360 for 10 Euro or so, and I was expecting a nice shooter without too much story and a lot of graphical violence. And well, frankly even with that expectation it disappointed me.<br /><br />First of all I want to say that I like the original idea of wallwalking, etc. It cóuld have been very innovative if it wasn't for the developer turning this game into a semi-puzzel/platform game every once in a while. I said this a lot of times and I'm gonna say it again; platformgames and shooters dón't mix, period. I like a challenge, but for example I was trapped in one (big) level for a entire week before I found out that to progress in the game, I had to shoot a small electro-tube somewhere on the wall... What kind of game-logic is that?! So if you want to complete this game and you find yourself stuck, the best thing to do is thus basically shoot at everything and hope it triggers a door or anything... It is NOT the way I want to play a game! The most 'innovative' part of this game are the portals, and even though Valve's Portal-mod does a far much better job at this today then Prey, it is a cool effect (at least for sight). Is it necessary? No. Is it confusing? Very much. Most of the time when you enter a portal, you will flip upside-down , or sideways in a way that it will leave you desorientated for a brief few seconds and thus very vulnerable to enemy attacks even with the most 'elite' shooterskills.<br /><br />The weapons are also not very great. Every gun looks like a cliché alien-gun, complete with bright lights and shiny texture. You have a sort of plasma-gun, a gun that you can load up with elemental stuff like fire, electricity, cold. You also get a gun that fires what could be described as a load of snot... Well, do I need to say more? Its as if the developers of this game weren't even trying. Oh, and you also get to play with the lamest, and I mean the LAMEST main-character in a shooting-game EVER. At the start of the game, the Indian-guy doesn't bother you much, but further in the game his whining about his girlfriend and his childish and furthermore simply dull one-liners (""Damn, its dark in here!"" - as if I didn't notice that myself Sherlock!) will probably tick you off and will leave you with no feeling for the main-character at all.<br /><br />And some more bugs: some 'puzzles' (read: annoying counterparts) require a lot of 'spiritpower' to turn on switches and so, but if this runs out, you will have no other choise then to kill yourself in order to get more 'spiritpower' (and no, there are no spirit power-ups in the levels apart from a few). And if you don't have any bug-grenades (how original...) or alien-rockets (sigh) you will just have to reload a old game and try again. Also, what is it with the graphics? I mean, the game on XBox 360 already looks like it could have run fine on the first XBox (and I'm not kidding there), but some images are just too dark. And I don't mean just dark, but pitch black... Even a shitty lighter that your character can activate can't change much about that.<br /><br />So this pretty much sums up what it is; A failed experiment, hyped with the now very popular Doom 3-engine. If you want a innovative and exciting shooter, go play Half-Life 2 (again), or the new Portal-mod I mentioned earlier. Do yourself as a shooterfan a favor, ignore the hype and just leave this game for what it is.",unsup
10839_0,"If only the developers concentrated more on the characters and story, making some innovative levels and lots of enemies, instead of rushing this game out, Prey could have been one of the better 3D-shooters of all time.

Prey does throw out some gameplay innovations at you such as gravity manipulation and spirit walking which allows for some interesting puzzles but all that really fizzles out at the end. Prey also feels too much like Doom-3 and is almost as dark on many occasions. There are very few weapons and enemies too which shows that this game had been rushed.

10840_0,"In many ways ""Prey"" is a weird case as far as development goes. The normal development cycle for a game these days is 1 to 2 years. Maybe even a couple more for the more higher profile games. However, was originally thought up in 1996. But the development team at 3D Relms had shoved the game aside to go work on ""Duke Nuckeum Forever"". It was about 2 years ago that ""Prey"" re-surfaced, and with a new developer in the form of ""Human-Head Studios"". And now, after 10 years in the making ""Prey"" is finally out. While all of the original content is mainly still in the game, the game has been revamped and remade with the ""Doom 3"" engine to run the game.<br /><br />""Prey"" tells a rather different and original story as far as shooters go. You play as Tommy, a native American who lives on an Indian reservation with his girl friend Jen and his grandfather Enisi. Tommy has always rejected the beliefs of his people. Enisi has always tried to teach him of the old ways. However, Tommy just wants to leave the reservation and go out to see the world. The only thing stopping him, is that his girlfriend Jen wont go with him. As she wants to stay. All this is presented to the player rather quickly. With not a whole lot of development, beyond the main subject. Because before long the three are sucked up by an alien space ship. And it pretty much comes down to Tommy trying to rescue his girlfriend. However, in the process ( as you may expect ) you save the world.<br /><br />The game play in ""Prey"" eventually does boil down to your basic shooter. As you go threw each level blasting your way through enemies. However, the game has some unique twists that try to set the game aside from the normal shooter formula. These take the form of ""Wall Walk"" and ""Spirit Walk"". In the case of ""Wall Walk"", Tommy can walk on walls in certain intervals threw-out the space ship. There are certain walkways that will lead on the wall, and sometimes the ceiling, and you can walk threw those areas. There is also times when you can actually change the entire formation of the level. In which you can change the gravity pull of the level to the new ground. And the entire level will shift to make that the new ground. During the times, it can be discontenting, especially when you walk from one ground to the other. However, it is a neat effect overall. And helps give the game a different feel in some ways.<br /><br />The other case of ""Spirit Walk"", in which Tommy can walk out of his body. These are used mainly for puzzle solving. You will find an area that you cant go to, and you can use ""Spirit Walk"" to reach those areas. It works well in many cases. However, the one big flaw is when you die. Instead of having to restart a level, you will leave your body and go to the spirit world. Where you will be on a pillar, and you must shoot a certain amount of wraiths that are flying around you to continue on. This effect works in one way, in that it never takes you out of the action. However, where it fails is that it takes all of the challenge out of the game. Because death really has no tole on you in ""Prey"". And while you will have the will to take more chances ( which is good ) you know that there really is no problem with dying. Since the worst that could happen is you will have to sit out for a few seconds.<br /><br />These new takes on the genre are interesting in many ways. And ""Prey"" tries to make them work well. However, they really don't add much to what is otherwise a very linear and strait forward game. In which boils down to a constant corridor crawl threw the space ship.<br /><br />The action in ""Prey"" is roughly 90%, with the other being some light and easy puzzle solving. The shooting in ""Prey"" is good, it feels right and you have a decent amount of weapons. However, the enemies you fight in ""Prey"" are rather easy. They don't do a whole lot to protect themselves and are very easy to eradicate. It also doesn't help that the game only has a very small amount of enemies. You start out only fighting a couple at a time and having an easy time doing so. The game tries to make things more interesting near the end of the game by throwing more enemies at you at once. However, it doesn't really change the game up much. The weapons have a neat and interesting organic look to them, however, the weapons at times feel under powered.",unsup

I bought Prey off Ebay for 5.00 pounds and When I played it the first thing I realized was the beautiful and realistic graphics. I eagerly jumped into playing Prey and was completely astounded to what I thought would be a sh*t game. You control a Cherokee Indian whose life is a bummer. His girlfriend thinks that Tommy Dommasi is difficult and he doesn't get along with his grandfather because he doesn't believe all that spiritual and superstitious stuff. The gunplay is excellent and the guns themselves are different because they are alive and very different to earthly guns, mainly because he is aboard a alien spaceship. The gore is overly disgusting and disturbing, all the way through the game you will see blood, guts, and livers. The gore is very important to the game because without it the atmosphere will feel dull and pedantic.<br /><br />After his girlfriend and grandfather get kidnapped by an alien spaceship, Tommy tries to release them from the clutches of evil. As the game progresses onward, you realize it isn't that easy. The ship is controlled by a power hungry leader who steals people from different planets for what they call ""Harvesting"", meaning to eat. Along the way you earn a power called spirit walking, you leave your body in a state of meditation while you do what you have to do with your spirit, and you shoot with guns that will blow your mind.<br /><br />The worst thing about this game is the easiness of it. It will take you about 5 or 7 hours to finish the game. The portals are so important in this game and Prey was the first game ever to have portals in it. Defying gravity was one of the fun things in this game but it can get weird sometimes because you have to shoot in a way which would make your brain dizzy and fuzzy. Prey is enjoyable and somewhat stupid because when the enemy is about to throw a grenade they call out, ""Grenade"" and then you can easily avoid it. Prey should be in every gamers collection and have a wonderful time playing. Happy Gaming!",unsup
10843_0,"Each year, I wait for something to come out to blow me away. FEAR was the last one that I actually could not get enough of. Now PREY appears, and WHOA, what a ride. Fantastic visuals (I mean FANTASTIC). Great dynamics in control of the characters, cool weapons, the anti gravity stuff and portals are mentioned quite a bit by most who comment on this game, but they are just part of the whole thing.<br /><br />The voice acting is almost uniformly great (with the exception of Jen sometimes), and the story is mostly original, save the overall plot, which we've seen a zillion times before. But the characters are new to the genre, (nope, no super human marines, or master gunfighters) and treats the traditions of the Cherokee with respect and dignity.<br /><br />There are some moments where it feels like some other games, an occasional dopey boss battle, and too many elevators, but wow, the overall pace, artwork, character control, and AWESOME MUSIC makes it the most movie like video game I've EVER played. Yes, even more than Half Life 2. The health regeneration is a little annoying at first, but then you learn to appreciate it somewhat, as it is less disruptive than having to go back 2 or 3 saves and start over.<br /><br />One more comment on the music. I was amazed at how cinematic it was. I felt like I was in a live action movie sometimes. Just awesome.<br /><br />My library of PC games numbers over 100, and I've played them all. But this one is in a class by itself. Yes, its somewhat short, but the work that went into it was intense.<br /><br />I can't wait for more. Kudos to the developers and artists that built this thing. What a piece of work",unsup
10844_0,"The Developers took a huge chance in releasing a demo for Prey which employed most of the game, and it paid off, big time! I enjoyed Prey because it was not hard or too confusing. Fast paced and with the all important objective to reach, this game seems to have it all. Graphics wise Prey is up to date, I guess it compares well to the likes of F.E.A.R, doom 3 and everybody's favorite, Halfe-life 2. But this is where the similarity ends apart from the Alien weapons you get to Mame and kill with. The biggest feature to my mind is the use of physics in the form of Gravity. Isaac Newton would be astounded. Wall Walking upside down if you please and reverting to a spirit state where you can indeed walk thru walls and invisible (to the human eye only) structures. I enjoyed it thoroughly but not for its shoot and kill aspect but more for its original storyline. I would describe it as ""Area 51"" meets ""doom 3"". I guess for me, the true sign of a good game is one that you are looking forward to continuing on with and maybe playing again at a later date. But for my money the obvious reason is that this game has been well developed, probably game tested over and over to bring a game that is satisfying and bug free. Although my system is of the high end type, a lot of games still fail at some stage, not Prey. This was the exception to the rule and I thank the Developers for spending the extra time on making it this way. I'm looking forward to ""prey 2"".",unsup
10845_0,"In the past couple of years, there've been some pretty breath-taking games released. Resident Evil 4, Half-Life 2 and FarCry are just some of the amazing titles to bless retailer's shelves in the 21st Century. These games, when released, were instant classics, and will remain classics until we actually start to be able to feel the sweet squish of virtual Goombas beneath our hyper-technologically clad feet. And so, games developers have come up with a challenge. Games like RE4 and HL2 set the bar pretty high when it comes to what's outstanding and what's average, therefore making it somewhat difficult for designers to take their audience's breaths away. However, Prey has not only managed to jump well over the bar, but has raised it that extra notch higher whilst doing so.<br /><br />Prey's storyline goes like this. Big nasty aliens come down and abduct our hero Tommy, his girlfriend Jen and his Grandfather Enisi. Anyway, Tommy manages to escape and heads off through the Alien spaceship's eerie corridors in search of Jen and Enisi. However, he soon learns that he has bigger problems than just rescuing the ones he loves<br /><br />Okay, so admittedly Prey doesn't have the most innovative storyline ever. In fact, it's relatively basic.at first. Later on, things start to get a little more complicated what with spirits and all that shabazz. However, Prey's storyline, however basic, is solid, and will keep you pressing forward through the game just to see what happens next. Now before I go on to talk about Prey's game play etc,. I need to mention the graphics in the game. Remember Half-Life 2? Remember how graphically astounding that was? Forget it. Prey's graphics absolutely kicks Half-Life 2's ass everywhere. I usually don't consider graphics when playing a game because I'm one of those people who prefer game play over graphics, but Prey had me astounded. You can see every little detail in your weapons, in the aliens, in the spaceship, everything looks gorgeous. Never have I played a game before that has had me standing in the middle of a wide-open area admiring my surroundings. If games were based on graphics alone, then Prey would win outright. The game play in Prey is also something that makes this game so great. It's easy to control, as are most PC-based FPS titles, and there's never a dull moment. If you're not taking down a 20 foot alien with two gattling guns attached to either arm (Barrett Wallace eat your heart out), then you're walking up walls or walking through force fields as a spirit. Even when you die, you carry on playing. Confused? Well basically when you die you get taken to a kind of Cherokee limbo, where you must use your spirit bow to kill the ""dishonored dead"", and by doing so replenishing your health and spirit. It's all innovation in Prey! Oh, and let's not forget the portals! Oh yeah, they can be used as a door and..as a.and a..okay, well the use of portals in this game, while interesting, not very well done. I was hoping to see some pretty amazing stuff done with portals, but basically that's all they're used for; cool-looking doors. However, it is weird the way that you can shoot through a portal and pop yourself one in the back of the head. Fun, but if in a real-life situation, not advisable. The sounds in Prey are also pretty cool. You can hear engines running, pieces of flesh squelching and blood splattering, so again the attention to detail is magnificent. The voice-acting in Prey is also brilliant, which is good because bad voice-acting can spoil a game (Final Fantasy X-2 anyone?). Whilst playing games, I always take notice of the game's music, and how well it is used, and Prey's use of music can be compared to that of Lord of the Rings. In other words, it's amazing. The music really shines through whilst fighting bosses, or a lot of enemies at the same time. Overall, Prey is outstanding. Never before have I played an FPS quite like this. The storyline is terrific and really drags you in, and at one point in the game actually had me not wanting to click my mouse to fire my weapon, because of what would happen. And when I finally got the courage to, I felt sorry. The graphics are stunning, the game play is even better and the music is epic. Forget game of 2006. Forget game of the century. Prey simply has to be one of the best games EVER to grace this planet, and, when it eventually lands in the bargain bin in ASDA, it will stand proudly in Game Heaven alongside Final Fantasy VII and Super Mario 64.",unsup
10846_0,"Development phases familiar from covert Pentagon pet projects beckon misunderstanding from the gaming cadres, and Prey exemplifies this nicely.<br /><br />Bound for tragedy, the nine year old title has made it to stores this summer triumphant, albeit the interminable delay from first showcasing in 1997 to shelves circa 2006 has resulted in much confusion, hence the less-than-stellar critical reactions you may see elsewhere.<br /><br />For Prey is being bunched with the on-going, and oft exhilarating, slew of first person shooters, still in vogue and dominating proceedings, particularly on the PC. However, it isn't one such game despite following the genre's visual conventions. In fact, it has more in common with 80's pioneers Cinemaware, whose glorious and ignominious interactive movies on the Amiga were cast aside, like Prey accused of low difficulty levels and pre-scripted events.<br /><br />Of course quite easy and pre-scripted, because Prey doesn't wish to come across hard to get or sophisticated, but, lo and behold, simply fun. It is one of the smoothest games we've seen in recent years, compelling players along not by hardened challenge but rather sheer pleasure and a desire to see what's in store next.<br /><br />It is also an amazingly stable game, suffering none of the encumbrances known to occur with alarming regularity in other titles. To that extent, Prey resembles last year's Area 51, another roller coaster ride crucified by industry and players for being too timid and lacking the simple press power of its Doom, Half-Life and FEAR siblings.<br /><br />Forget all that: Prey is a masterpiece, putting fun and superlative storytelling first. A big boon is the maturity of the tale, with a lot of good language, real gore and even fighting against wicked children.<br /><br />Reasonably enjoyable action and quite attractive visuals help, but above all else it's the game's consideration of players that wins us over. It's never too hard or frustrating, and gives you those vital ingredients somehow often missing in other releases.<br /><br />For starters, the way it all begins, at a remote reservation bar on a dark, stormy night. Protagonist Tommy, considered Cherokee by his grandfather Anisi and girlfriend Jen, but really eager to shed that identity and look for a new one. This scene introduces characters and play mechanics well, preparing Tommy for the fight ahead, as an unknown force kidnaps him and his loved ones, forcing the reluctant hero on a path of discovery and courage.<br /><br />But here we also glimpse Prey's professionalism: jukeboxes come with a host of full rock tracks, clocks animate and change in real time, rain falls outside in rhythm, and Don't Fear the Reaper plays just at the right moment. Beautiful.<br /><br />The cavalcade of neat touches doesn't not stop there, with the unfolding alien environment into which Tommy is cast feeling real and consistent. There's cyborg weapons that move and squirm as you hold them, cool snippets of radio host Art Bell's UFO-centric late night show Coast to Coast AM, memorable alien propaganda and even wacky perspective changes. That's among Prey's chief innovations, enabling players to walk on walls and traverse portals that zip one among locations, a feature generating more than a few fun puzzles.<br /><br />Opponents, most twisted and delectably incorrect in the political department, deploy excellent animation, and while obviously inspired by those from the aforementioned shooter franchises and even the Matrix movies, are engrossing in engagement and leave a lasting, entertaining impression. None are overly challenging or intelligent, and in fact the AI can't do much more than move around or take random cover, but it wouldn't matter anyway, since you can't die.<br /><br />That's right, not only does the game allow saves anytime, players are also technically invincible courtesy of Tommy's Spritiwalk ability, an alternate game mode akin to Area 51's mutant switch. Learned in the beautifully-realized Land of the Ancients realm, Spiritwalk opens up areas off-limits to the physical body, granting Tommy a mythical bow weapon that's frankly of little use. Importantly, when the material shell dies, the spirit lives on, ultimately allowing for a return to almost the exact spot where Tommy died. No restarting levels and that kind of shinola here.<br /><br />That's the crux of it: you're not supposed to win, beat or conquer Prey, but kick back and relish the ride, just like a truly good movie. Therefore, its cinematography is definitely up to spec, Human Head's penchant for detail and drama paying dividends as gamers witness moments of shock, horror and suspense.<br /><br />The Doom-derived engine produces pleasing visuals, but they won't blow you away for technical achievement. Instead, it's the design that matters, even though Prey boils down to another corridor crawl when all's said and done. They're nice, atmospheric corridors, though, thus rarely repetitive, and Prey also avoids Doom 3's problematic love of dark spaces, something it references in one of several humorous moments.<br /><br />The minimalist, but oh-so appropriate soundtrack shines, delivering psychedelic refrains, sci-fi mood-pieces and addictive rock just where they count. Effects contribute their fair share, and you'll soon be quipping one liners provided by Tommy's prolific adversaries, the Hunters. Weapons and other contraptions sound great, and the Spiritwalk portion comes with chanting voices that get into one's head easy. Do note the top-notch voice acting, making everyone come off as champions of their respective roles, in particular the sinister enemy bosses.<br /><br />Prey does its literary and cinematic sources of inspiration proud. Stuff like the Alien universe, Shyamalan's Signs, 80's series V, the X Files, Independence Day and classic invasion novel Footfall all find a home here, as do players who appreciate a tight, comprehensive package that simply makes you feel good about being a gamer.<br /><br />Rating: * * * * 1/2",unsup
10847_0,Such a shame that this program was canceled mid-season. It was a great chick series! Such a romantic series with a lady lawyer and a policeman husband. The families were Catholic and very close. It was sort of a step-back in time for those of who remember when families were close and shared Sunday dinners along with great conversation around the dinner table. The acting was really great and the young couple seemed so natural and true. Did anyone else out there ever see this program besides me? I always seem to get hooked on programs that are canceled early on in the season and I know it is because I am the only one who watches the show.,unsup

The chemistry between the characters was good. And i also remember different kinds of interesting side stories concerning family matters. It is a pity that it wasn't successful. Because it stopped after only one season. Unfortunately, because i really liked it. So now i have a question. Because I'd like to see this series again.

Conversely, his new co-workers regard his as a stereotype come to life...and an escapee from the Twilight Zone.<br /><br />Watching the Yank and the Canucks learn first to tolerate than take a positive delight in one another is a riot. Judy, the news producer who is Jake's boss and foil, is a delight: Mary Richards as woman of (mostly) steel. Bill, the station manager is a continual laugh as a man who really believes he knows all about Americans but who really needs to get a clue or three.<br /><br />This show is always fun for what is says about Canada and Canadians as much as what it says about us.

10850_0,"The OMEN, CARRIE, DAMIEN, CARRIE, LAURA MARS, and even HIGH ANXIETY... wasn't he late 70s full of ghastly eye-rolling trubbbble! BURNT OFFERINGS and even AUDREY ROSE.... some paranormal some psychic most pukey (but DAMIEN OMEN 2 was terrific, and ANXIETY genuinely hilarious) .......and then the worst this one, THE FURY. It is a weak link in an ordinary chain of thrillers. I really disliked it 30 years ago and groaned even more again tonight. As the film progressed, with awful back projected car chases and hammy faux Hermann/Hitchcock music score, implausible plot twists (personal phone calls to pubic railway platforms etc) and basically disgusting bleeding and body part effects THE FURY was considered a major misfire in 1978. After his fabulous PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE and horrible CARRIE and spew worthy BODY DOUBLE and the hilariously awful but compelling SCARFACE in the 80s, I basically gave up on De Palma and I actually believe most audiences did too. I ran cinemas at the time and the audiences let us know their irritation at his bad films well known. Andrew Stevens was a surprise in the casting and effective very early on as the male version of Amy Irving but sadly absent for most of the rest of the film. Cassavetes. like Douglas must have wanted some cash to buy a holiday house and accepted the silly parts offered here. THE FURY should be remade as an orgasm comedy even with the same script, then it would be more plausible and enjoyable. That's its best and only possibility for a new century audience.",unsup
10851_0,"""The Fury"" has gotten better with age and can now be viewed as one of DePalma's most satisfying thrillers. It consists of two stories which eventually overlap. The first story deals with a former government agent (Kirk Douglas) who searches for his son, who has been kidnapped by the feds who want to exploit his telekinetic powers. The second story revolves around a teenaged girl (Amy Irving) who discovers that she too has paranormal powers. Eventually, Douglas enlists her aid in finding his son. The film includes some unexpected humor and several breathtaking sequences, to include a stunning shot where Irving's character is surrounded by past images of Douglas' son (you gotta see it to believe it). The denouement is contrived, but effective and has been ripped by other films.",unsup
10852_0,"Well, I initially saw this movie because I am a major Carrie fan and I wanted to see another movie with Amy Irving when she was still young. The movie was good, but John Cassevetes and the Kirk Douglas characters were kind of boring. I always thought that john Cassevetes is a little overrated because I've never seen him display a personality that is incredibly enjoyable(even with Rosemary's baby) and in this movie he was his usual negotiating boring self. There was some cool action scenes with Kirk Douglas but my main love of the movie was the majority of the scenes with Amy Irving--who really(despite the billing) is the main stand out character of the film. We watch some really cool scenes with amy involving her watching Andrew Stevens psychically as Andrew watches video tapes of his father being attacked, blood running down other people as Amy's emotions are racing with energy., a sleepwalking scene, a show where she is escaping from the hospital, a scene where she gives a girl a bloody nose, and blue glowing eyes. Amy and Andrew were the two telekinetic teens and they were young, fresh, emotional, and attractive. I really enjoyed their presence and their performance really made the film work. The other characters are really just there for support except Kirk Douglas who gives his usual masculine role. Overall I thought the film was pretty good, 2 1/2 mainly because of the acting, special effects, and the way some scenes just looked so cool! I'd recommend this.",unsup
10853_0,"This is one gorgeous knockout of horror movie--beautifully directed by De Palma and acted by Amy Irving. The script is elaborate junk, but on imagery alone this ranks with Murnau's Nosferatu and Dreyer's Vampyre as among the greatest horror movies ever made. Like those classics, the imagery is more entrancing than terrifying--I never wanted to hide my eyes. The last half-hour is just incredibly intense. Check out the way De Palma cuts from the Gothic night horror of Douglas's confrontation with his demon son to Amy Irving's cozy sunlit bedroom the next day. I always laugh out loud at this transition--because of course the director is just softening us up for the greatest horror climax in movies.",unsup
10854_0,"This movie is imperfect (it sags a bit in the third quarter, and some major factors in the plot are unexplained or confusing), but it is a great mix of fear and excitement. The cinematography is quite ahead of its time (the camera rarely sits still, yet remains unobtrusive), the drama is milked for maximum effect (and there are numerous sudden shocks), and the science-fiction/occult aspects of the film never overshadow the human element. Two similar movies, David Cronenberg's Scanners and The Brood, have more science and are more amusingly grotesque, but The Fury has a coolness and tightness to it that might just beat them both.",unsup

10856_0,"""The Fury"" is another underrated thriller from Brian DePalma, the ""Master of the Macabre"" (a title he earned, in my opinion). This film actually owes little to Hitchcock, other than a few directorial touches. DePalma here creates a dazzling original, with superb special effects and strong acting and a solid plot.<br /><br />""The Fury"" shares a few similarities with DePalma's previous film ""Carrie"". It is based on a best seller (by John Farris, who adapted his novel). Both films feature Amy Irving, then a newcomer to films. Both deal with psychics and telekinesis. And both are strong character studies grafted onto a thriller. <br /><br />""The Fury"" is a great deal more complicated in terms of the storyline than ""Carrie"" was. The film stars Kirk Douglas in a strong performance as a government agent whose son (a psychic) was kidnapped. John Cassavetes plays the kidnapper, who happens to be Douglas' partner (all these connections are established within the first 20 minutes, so I'm not spoiling it for you) The bulk of the film deals with Gillian (Amy Irving), another psychic who Douglas enlists to find his son. Over the course of the film, there are a great many surprises and revelations that DePalma just throws at the viewer. But don't worry about being confused. DePalma makes everything clear as it progresses.<br /><br />""The Fury"" finds DePalma working with mostly new collaborators, although a few (editor Paul Hirsch and some of the actors)are DePalma veterans. Despite the change, the technical credits are still first rate. The cinematographer is Richard H. Kline, who has shot many different kinds of films (exploitation, Hollywood, independent) and his photography is excellent, with great use of shadows and light. The score is by John Williams (famous for ""Jaws"", ""Star Wars"" and many, many Hollywood films) and it is an extremely effective one, but one wonders if Pino Donaggio might have done a better job (especially after his mesmerizing work in ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Carrie"" and especially ""Blow Out""). But still, I want to say that Williams' score is very good, especially towards the films' climatic moments. And Paul Hirsch's editing accomplishes exactly what it did for ""Carrie"".<br /><br />The acting is first rate as well. Kirk Douglas gives his usual strong performance and I go on record as saying that he is one of our most overlooked actors. John Cassavetes makes a memorable villain and although this job was most likely for the money (he acted to finance his own films; this job probably financed ""Gloria""), he doesn't sleepwalk through his role unlike some actors. Charles Durning returns as another villain, adding to his collection of offbeat and memorable performances (The Muppet Movie added another)and Amy Irving is very good as the psychic who helps Douglas. And if you pay close attention, you'll see Bill Finley in a cameo in the first 12 minutes or so. (And if you pay really close attention, you'll see Jim Belushi)<br /><br />As is the case with most DePalma thrillers, ""The Fury"" has a wow of an ending. It is probably the greatest of the DePalma endings, one of such satisfaction and plausibility that you won't stop talking about it for hours after the film is over. There is a deliberate pace and some of the middle scenes are sluggish, but fortunately, they don't last long and DePalma gives us our money's worth. ""The Fury"" is not the best of the DePalma thrillers (""Dressed to Kill"" gets my vote), but it is an excellent film that combines intelligence and craftmanship. It is a must see.<br /><br />**** out of 4 stars",unsup
10857_0,"A scary and good old-fashioned joy ride that concentraits on an aging goverment agent, Peter Sandza (Kirk Douglas - ""Ben-Hur"") who finds help from Gillian (Amy Irving - ""Traffic""), a teenage girl who's surprised to learn that she has special abilities and he relies on her to find out where a crooked adversary of his, Childress (the late John Cassavetes - ""The Dirty Dozen"") is doing with his psychic son, Robin (Andrew Stevens).<br /><br />Brian DePalma (""Carrie"", ""The Untouchables"") directs here and he applies the hair-raising details where they're needed. John Farris used his novel in adapting the screenplay. Rick Baker's make-up and special effects are a delight to see and the ending is a good example of that. And legendary composer John Williams serves up a tense and enjoyable musical score. The opening theme is the best one to listen to.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the performances are first-rate hands down.

First of it's kind and SADLY short lived as it went bankrupt and was demolished 6 years after it's closing. I remember always seeing the commercials on TV advertising the place and we begged our mom and dad to take us there. I had been there a few times with my parents and never thought I would/could see it again until I learned a scene in this movie was filmed inside of it. It made me feel good when I watched the scene and remembered the interior of the place exactly. If anyone that reads this has any souvenirs, t-shirts or other memorabilia, please let me know.",unsup
10864_0,"""The Fury"" came out after Brian DePalma's classic, ""Carrie."" And like the previous film, it's about a girl with a mental ability, but she's far from alone.<br /><br />As the film opens, we find out that Peter Sandza (Kirk Douglas)has been double crossed by his best friend (And fellow government agent) Childress (John Cassavetes). It seems that Childress wants Peter's son Robin (Andrew Stevens), who has an amazing psychic ability. Childress wants Robin so bad that he stages a shootout while they're in Israel and attempts to kill Peter (His son thinks he's dead).<br /><br />Peter turns up in Chicago sometime later, searching for his son and staying a step ahead from the government agents that want him out of the way. He finds out that Gillian Bellaver (Amy Irving)may be able to help him find him. Gillian is freaked out about her ability: whenever she touches someone, it causes them to bleed. Seeking help from The Paragon Institute, she soon finds out 2 things: Robin was there before her and that she has a connection to him. What she doesn't know is that Childress has become interested in her abilities, and wants to replace Robin with her.<br /><br />Robin, meanwhile, has become increasingly unstable (Despite incredibly high dosages of medications that would kill a normal person, they have no effect on him at all)and increasingly dangerous (He's developed an ability to manipulate machines and doing the same to himself). He is so much of a threat that he causes a section of a ferris wheel to crash into a building because the guys were Middle Eastern (A trigger for what happened in Israel to his father).<br /><br />There are some plot holes that have nagged me (You would figure after the incident at the carnival that they would have had a clue to how increasingly dangerous he's become). The film gets bloody, but the ending in which Gillian causes the bad guy to explode (using her powers)is still effective (Keep in mind that this was 3 years BEFORE the exploding head scene in ""Scanners""). Some of the content may be a bit ""politically incorrect"" in this post 9/11 society: Robin's actions at the carnival were triggered by what happened in Israel, even though these guys had nothing to do with what happened. So basically, Robin had committed a ""hate crime,"" killing them because they were Middle Eastern men. <br /><br />Keep your eye out for Daryl Hannah, Laura Innes, James Belushi and Dennis Franz in small parts. And John Williams fans will like the score to the film.",unsup
10865_0,"When I first saw ""The Fury"" I was blown away, there wasn't a thing I disliked about it. The story was fascinating, the casting supreme and it just hit me with a hook that I could not let go of. I don't know if it was just the time in my life or what, but I have always considered ""The Fury"" as one of my favorite movies. The story line was plausible, if you believed or considered that our minds are capable of more than we use them for, and the tension seemed real at the right times. I did not read the book, if there was one, so the movie held up and there was no let down, just a nice roller coaster ride for all to see. This movie has held up for me in, ""the test of time"".",unsup
10866_0,"Brian De Palma, for better or worse, loves to mess around with some of the expectations from the audience through the genre he's working in, and the Fury is a good, messy, peculiar case of how to do a highly stylized picture. It was the director's follow-up to Carrie, and here the horror of suburban school life is replaced with some more outrageously violent, practically astounding moments. There's also a lot of plot going on, too, or at least it might seem that way. Sometimes, too, the action and turns have to depend on a complete suspension of disbelief logic. De Palma holds this logic steady enough, and provides a combination of a Government thriller and psychic power drama. What helps though is the casting, as Kirk Douglas in hero mode works best through this very narrowly focused man on a mission; John Cassavetes in one of his very best acting roles as the cold- though devil-friendly- antagonist as he kidnaps his 'gifted' son. Amy Irving fills up the rest of the main acting bill as the female counterpart to the son, getting images and (bad) connections with what's happening to him. So, it is sort of silly stuff, but also taken seriously enough in this thriller form to go with. <br /><br />Occasionally there will be something that isn't directed quite well enough even when something interesting is going on. But most, if not all, of the scenes with a lot of action and multiple, gruesome deaths and various bleedings via psychic boy/girl, are fun and entertaining in that very stylish way that De Palma has with his thrillers, giving the audience what they've paid to see and such. And for the greater part of the film I bought into it, that Douglas could be this old man with enough sense to match skills as an ex-agent, or that Andrew Stevens as the son and Irving could be convincing as vulnerable, confused teens with certain 'unstable' ways. De Palma also gets some great atmospheric backup from John Williams' score, and the pleasure in the plausibility of some of the more graphic scenes. Whether it's up to par with the director's best work would depend on how much of a fan one might be of his more crazy, over-the-top pictures with darkly comic scenes amassed into a potboiler of a story that would make Hitchcock probably grin and wince in equal measure. <br /><br />By the way, the hype that has been brought up by the critics regarding the final scene lives up to it, and it's one of the best scenes of De Palma's career in just the sheer 'wow' level of gustiness, some pun intended.",unsup
10867_0,"When a former (?) agent in a supersecret government agency is on holiday with his son in Israel, a ""terrorist"" attack separates the father, Peter, from his son, Robin. Peter apparently dies, and the boy is whisked to ""safety"" by Peter's best friend, and government agency man.<br /><br />Peter isn't really killed (though his son is made to believe so) and he both takes some vengeance on almost being killed by wounding his former friend, and tries to reunite with his son. The following may contain spoilers.<br /><br />Robin, as it happens, has a powerhouse of psychic abilities. This was never hinted at before the attack, which makes it odd that the action was even staged. However, Robin is taken to a facility where agency folk work at developing his powers. (A little of this is akin to a setup in Firestarter, but that film spends more time on the testing than this).<br /><br />Robin is becoming increasingly powerful, and increasingly dangerous.<br /><br />In the meantime, a young girl, Gilliam, starts developing her own psychic abilities, particularly psychometry. She demonstrates this in class, and eventually is referred to an institute for ""gifted"" youngsters, actually a front for the agency that has Robin. As her powers develop, she shares visions from Robin and others that make her a tad unstable.<br /><br />In the meantime, Peter learns of her, and staying literally a step ahead of the secret agency, rescues her from the institute, inadvertently killing his newly found lover in the process (life has been unkind to Peter).<br /><br />Robin is getting so restless that he's allowed a night ""on the town,"" where he both gets increasingly insecure and sees Arab tourists, and psychokinetically causes a machine malfunction that kills or seriously injures them. <br /><br />Peter and Gilliam track Robin to an estate, with high security grounds, where, inside, Robin detects Gilliam's presence in the yard, and flips out, thinking that she's to replace him, and he's to be killed. So he kills his mentor and bed partner by psychokinetically spinning her to death as if she became a centrifuge.<br /><br />The violence of his actions cause Gillism to freak out, and her screams alert the security forces that capture her and Peter. Peter finally is allowed to see his son, who has in the meantime killed a number of agency people by hurling them away psychokinetically.<br /><br />If Robin recognizes his father as a loving family member, it isn't evident. He leaps at Peter, the two go through a window, and despite Peter's best efforts at trying to rescue his son, the two fall to their death, one by one. Life definitely hasn't been kind to Peter.<br /><br />Major Spoiler Alert! As he lay dying, Robin apparently passes something -- his power? A compulsion? no matter -- to Gilliam. With everybody dead but Peter's former friend and Gilliam, she awakens to find him trying to soft-soap recruiting her. She takes revenge, destroying him psychokinetically.<br /><br />End of film!<br /><br />The film built up a fairly complex, interwoven story, but left Gilliam in limbo. What happens next? Does she get away? Does she hook up with her globetrotting mother? Are there other agency types who will capture her or die trying? The film would have been much better without these many loose ends.",unsup
10868_0,"i enjoyed this Brian De Palma paranormal thriller/horror.it.may seem tame by today's standards,but back then,i'm sure it was probably pretty terrifying to some people.i thought it was also revolutionary.there are some pretty graphic images that i found a bit disturbing,even though i've seen a lot of horror/thrillers.but this is not just some slice'n dicer.there's a story in here,and the gory parts are part of the story.John Farris wrote the screenplay adapted from his novel.and he has quite a few excellent novels that in the right hands would make good films.***possible minor spoiler ahead***like many people i thought Scanners(which came out 3 years later) was revolutionary.but the Fury paved the way for that film.(and yes,The Fury borrows form Carrie,another DePalma film.in fact some of the sequences in Scanners were nearly identical to those in the Fury,but were actually not as graphic.i think The Fury is actually a superior film.Amy Irving is terrific,and steals the show.the supporting cast is also good,with Kirk Douglas,Carrie Snodgress,John Cassavetes,Andrew Stevens,and Fiona Lewis.Charles Durning also has a small role.an unrecognizable Melody Thomas Scott(Nikki Newman from the long running soap The Young and the Restless)also has what amounts to a cameo.but it's Dennis Franz in his very brief appearance that is hysterical in a bit of comic relief performance.as for the movie itself,if you have a weak stomach or don't like horror films,i suggest you avoids this.but if you like being scared,pop this in late at night for maximum effect.my vote for The Fury is a 9/10 P.S. some people may find this movie slow by today's standards,but that merely builds up the suspense and is well worth sitting through.",unsup
10869_0,"Really dreadful piece of schlock. I can only imagine that the author of the book it was based on was disappointed (or was handsomely paid) for the rights.<br /><br />I can't complain about the acting, such as it is. It features a good cast but there's not much they can do with what they're given.<br /><br />I have never been impressed with Brian De Palma. I find his work highly overrated and over the top. What he does to poor poor Cassevetes in this is just awful.<br /><br />The worst part is the very end and in a way reveals the De Palma's worst instincts. The Amy Irving character basically makes him explode. This is gory enough. But it gives De Palma an opportunity to show the body exploding (and it being special effects circa 1978 its not anything realistic) from five or six angles. I mean you see the body explode over and over again as if the Amy Irving character used her blue eyed powers to explode and stitch together again and explode the body again and again. Just ridiculous stuff. If Mystery Science Theater was still around and lasted for another 15 years, I have no doubt they would've gotten around to screening ""The Fury.""<br /><br />A waste of talent all around.",unsup

10870_0,"After the success of Carrie (1976), Brian De Palma followed up with another outstanding film about youths with incredible telepathic powers.<br /><br />Government agent's telepathic son is kidnapped and along with a similarly-gifted teenage girl he seeks to save him.<br /><br />Based upon the novel by John Farris, The Fury is a film that could have easily became a mundane action film if not for the splendid direction of De Palma and an outstanding cast. De Palma once again shows his excellent directorial style and his technique for grand suspense. The Fury has some great action sequences, a tremendous climax, and one outrageous conclusion! Makeup FX artist Rick Baker lends his talents to create some good blood-letting, especially for that knock-out closing image. John Williams also deserves special mention for his wonderfully powerful music score.<br /><br />Star Kirk Douglas is great as the government agent searching for his son. John Cassavetes is good as the films cold villain. Amy Irving and Andrew Stevens are both sympathetic as youths attempting to live with their amazing mental powers. Supporting cast Snodgress, Durning, and Lewis are also good.<br /><br />All around The Fury is a pretty under appreciated thriller that firmly ranks among the best of De Palma's films.<br /><br />*** 1/2 out of ****",unsup
10871_0,"De Palma's films generally fall into two camps: <br /><br />- the ones where his visual bravura, deeply satirical worldview and smart self-referencing compensate for his discarding of more grounded storytelling tools: perceived realism, narrative cohesion, plausible characterisation.<br /><br />- and the ones quite simply where they don't.<br /><br />In the former camp, find Carrie, Femme Fatale, Dressed to Kill, Snake Eyes, Blow Out and Body Double.<br /><br />In the latter, see The Black Dahlia, Bonfire of the Vanities, the M:I film, Raising Cain and Mission to Mars. Interesting failures, but failures all the same.<br /><br />Now to The Fury. Forget all the hysterical parodies of Carrie here, the hokum concerning psychic powers and government agencies and broken parental bonds. These things are the mundane prism through which De Palma shines his light, it refracting into a million shimmering little pieces.<br /><br />What is important is De Palma's relationship with The Fury's villain, John Cassavetes. Learned viewers will also recognise Cassavetes as the great, independent director of caustic dramas like Shadows, Woman Under the Influence and Faces. Check them out if you haven't already - they're soul-searing stuff.<br /><br />As a director, Cassavetes relied a lot on a realist aesthetic: harsh cinematography; an unshowy camera; claustrophobic interiors and close-ups; loose, improvisational performances. His characters are often trapped in their own psychological prisons. The harsh emotions that uncurl themselves slowly, cumulatively, in his films, are caught with the precision of a scalpel.<br /><br />If you're still with me, hopefully you see where I'm going with this.<br /><br />De Palma's operatic brand of film-making is an anathema to Cassavetes'. His camera takes flight like an angel and swoops like a demon. His eye is a voyeur, a lover, an aggressor, a stalker, a liar, a comfort, a cheat. One thing it isn't is passive.<br /><br />So The Fury sees a battle not between silly FBI men and even sillier psychics, but between two opposing cinematic approaches. De Palma as ever throws everything at the screen - overhead scans, dervish swoops, roaming pans, POV shots, gratuitous slo-mo, shots within shots, temporal shifts, imagined futures and projected pasts, disguises, hysteria, romance, death, the deep, deep red of spilt blood.<br /><br />Then we have Cassavettes' performance - a jet black presence lingering at the fringes of the frame. He understates every scene he's in, working against De Palma's rhapsodical movements. Its great fun to watch.<br /><br />There could however only be one winner. And how. Cassavetes' character literally explodes, destroyed by the strength of emotion (fury?) that is evoked by a great, rich vision (De Palma's). Neat.<br /><br />Can't believe someone as smart as Cassavetes went into this not seeing the bigger picture. He must have been paid handsomely.",unsup
10872_0,"The Fury starts in the 'Mid East 1977' where the head of a secret shadowy Government agency named Ben Childress (John Cassavetes) stages a fake terrorist attack so he can kidnap a teenage boy with powerful psychic abilities named Robin Sandza (Andrew Stevens) & leave his Father Peter (Kirk Douglas) dead. Half the plan works & Robin is whisked away but Peter manages to escape, he vows to find Childress & his son. Cut to 'Chicago 1978' & Dr. Jim McKeever (Charles Durning) is running the Paragon Institute for Childress, an institute that studies psychic abilities & tries to uncover people with these powers. Teenage girl Gillian Bellaver (Amy Irving) has been developing such powers & her Mother (Joyce Easton) agrees for her to spend some time in the institute in an attempt to help her. Meanwhile Peter is in Chicago & hot on the trail of Childress who becomes aware of Gillian & her powers which match Robins, Peter also knows about Gillian & the fact that she can help lead him to his son Robin. However Gillian & Robin start to suffer as they're powers grow stronger, it becomes almost impossible to control them...<br /><br />Directed by Brian De Palma I thought The Fury was a decent watch but nothing that special. The script by John Farris based on his own 1976 novel of the same name, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two although it's said that the film is considerably condensed, plays more like a thriller than horror for the first half, it sets up it's secret Government agency, the bad guy, the good guy, it has a few chases & even a bit of comedy relief in the shape of two bumbling cops & a new car. Then the film switches to more horror orientated territory with visions to sinister past events & psychic powers being used for evil & the two story elements come together at the end as Peter finds his son & Childress in a final confrontation type cliché. I thought the film dragged a little in places, too many elements just came & went too quickly & it ignores various aspects of it's story for long periods before going back to them which gave me the impression that it was was very inconsistent & at times a bit incoherent & confusing. It's never made clear as to why Childress is so interested in people with psychic abilities or what Government agency he works for. The story is complex, it's fairly engaging & gripping but at the same time it's rather dull & drawn out, I liked it for sure but I don't think I'd be in any hurry to watch it again.<br /><br />Director De Palma does a good job as you would expect from an accomplished director such as he. The Fury reminds heavily of Carrie (1976) with it's troubled teenage psychics which, by co-incidence or not, was the film De Palma made directly before The Fury. There is one sequence that inspired a few unintentional laughs though, the bit where Gillian breaks out of the Paragon Institute is played out in slow motion without any sound effects only some really awful & inappropriate music, it feels like it goes on forever. There's not much gore except for a cool bit at the end that looks like it belongs in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981) when someone explodes all over the place, it's replayed several times in slow motion & from various different camera angles as well.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $5,500,000 The Fury is a very well made film & certainly has that Hollywood polish about it. One area where the film suffers from is that it has dated badly, the cars, the interiors, all the sharp suits & the latest 70's fashions tell it's own story. The acting was OK, I didn't think Irving was that good as Gillian but Douglas manages to bring a certain likability to his role.<br /><br />The Fury is a good watch, it's a bit long & a bit inconsistent but it entertains & tries to tell a thoughtful story. Definitely worth a watch if you have a couple of hours to spare.",unsup

It is also worth noting that David Cronenberg's above-mentioned ""Scanners"" seem to owe a great deal to this movie.<br /><br />""The Fury"" balances brilliantly between weird and unexpected comedy (like the whole scene where Douglas carjacks two off-duty cops, one played by Dennis Franz!) and imaginative horror that will turn off anyone who hates blood. Great acting from everyone; worth noting the star-making performances of Amy Irving and Andrew Stevens, Douglas who has a field-day, Cassavetes who looks great as the sinister bad-guy and Carrie Snodgress who will touch your heart with her performance as the caring nurse Hester.<br /><br />The last scene is quite a kick, truly one of the most memorable finales ever shown on screen, and it could very well leave you cheering well into the end credits!",unsup
10875_0,"Fortunately, De Palma's hyperbolic, visually compelling, science fiction occult espionage thriller moves so fast that the ludicrous dialog, indifferent performances, and Swiss cheese plot don't spoil the fun. The Fury starts from an interesting premise, but De Palma is clearly more interested in the spectacular set pieces than in logic or characterization. And where Sissy Spacek was touching as Carrie, Amy Irving and Andrew Stevens as psychic teens who unleash the fury are whiny and callow, and you don't really care about their fates. Though Douglas, Snodgress, Cassavetes and De Palma regular William Finley ( Raymond Dunwoodie) are always interesting, the rest of the cast is pretty bad. And a scene between Irving and Douglas on a bus is embarrassingly bad. Still, The Fury with its telepathic visions, its pulse pounding score by John Willams and Richard H. Kline's elegant deep focus cinematography is far superior to junk like The Eyes of Laura Mars. De Palma pulls out all the stops and creates some spectacularly over-the-top scenes. Faults and all, The Fury is far more entertaining, and less pretentious and derivative than most of De Palma's more recent efforts to say nothing of Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Obsession, Wise Guys, Carlito's Way, Raising Cain, and The Bonfire of the Vanities.",unsup
10876_0,"The author of the excellent 'All Heads Turn As The Hunt Goes By', John Farris, wrote his version of 'Carrie' after that novel's success as book and film; it was called 'The Fury'. It also explored the subject of telekinesis (moving objects with the mind), but he stretched it over a broader, international canvas and threw a terrorism subplot, a fractured love story, an Argento-inspired school for cute, gifted girls, telekinetic rivalry, and John Cassavetes as an evil puppetmaster of troubled psychic warriors into the brew. Assisted immeasurably by John William's devastating, baroque score, Brian De Palma's film of Farris's screenplay is another example of stunning visual storytelling. Losing the direct Hitchcockian references, De Palma applies a harder, leaner style to the storytelling and creates a powerful work that is less fun than his later films, but no less compelling. As always, there are a number of stand-out sequences, and the stand-out sequence in this is Amy Irving's escape from the institute where she is being groomed for ""evil"" by the charming but twisted Cassavetes. Irving's flight into the street, shot in slow motion, is cinema at its purest, most transporting and erotic (Irving is wearing a nightie). William's scoring of this sequence is stunning. A carousel accident, orchestrated by ""evil"" psychic Andrew Stevens (in a chilling performance), has great entertainment value, and the liberal use of blood and bulging prosthetic facial veins goes a long way towards elevating this film to cult status. The finale, which features an exploding head (a pre-""Scanners"" exploding head, mind you) is simply bloody great.",unsup

If you'll remember he was abandoned on deserted asteroid. The Fury deals with a young man on the way to being another Gary Lockwood.<br /><br />Young Andrew Stevens has those abilities already, they just need to be focused and developed. Stevens is being raised by his widowed father Kirk Douglas who's a government agent. A raid while they're on vacation in the Mediterranean by some Arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by John Cassavetes to separate father from son. Stevens believes Dad has died, but Kirk doesn't swallow that so easy.<br /><br />Kirk's on the hunt for his son and the quest takes him to Chicago where people like Stevens with paranormal abilities are being studied and tested so the USA can have them as a weapon.

And so is Fiona Lewis who's been given personal charge of Stevens and develops the kid's libido as well as his telekinesis.<br /><br />Brian DePalma directed this film and it's a good one with outstanding performances by all the cast. Look for a good performance from Amy Irving as another young person with such abilities who literally makes Cassavetes fall apart at the end. And there's a memorable bit from a younger and thinner Dennis Franz before the gain of weight and loss of hair that we all know as Detective Andrew Sipowicz.

10878_0,"Brian DePalma's follow up to his popular ""Carrie"", was in many aspects a continuation of the mood he had already established in his former work. Thus, ""The Fury"" suffered because it was not an inspired choice for a man who knew better, but for whatever circumstances decided to go ahead with this project. The film is based on a novel by John Farris, which we never read, so there is no point of reference. Mr. Farris also wrote the screen treatment.<br /><br />This ambitious film travels from the Middle East to Chicago in a tale of intrigue and super natural forces that is incomprehensible, at times. The idea of having a gifted young man working for the bad guys and capitalizing on all that can be extracted from his prodigious mind, is a disturbing idea. That there could be another brilliant mind, a young woman, presents a challenge for the evil people that are trying to use them for evil purposes.<br /><br />The director was not as lucky with ""The Fury"" as with some of his best known, and more accomplished films. Amy Irving plays the young Gillian, who is terrified once she understands why she is so much wanted. In a way, she is an extension of Carrie, the heroine of the previous film. Kirk Douglas has some good moments. Carrie Snodgress was one of the best things in the movie. Charles Durning, Carol Rossen, and Fiona Lewis, do outstanding work. On the other hand, the great actor/director John Cassavetes seems to sleep walk through his role as the man behind the conspiracy. Darryl Hannah is seen briefly in the scene at Gillian's school.<br /><br />The film has an effective musical score from John Williams.

So Peter gets help from a girl with similar abilities to locate his son's whereabouts.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting too much from it after borrowing it off a friend that recommended it to me. After seeing it, it's probably De Palma's most underrated film in my books. It might not have dated that well and the premise of the film might be considered ludicrous now, but it doesn't stop it from being an exciting adventure.<br /><br />This is a flashy and mostly fast-paced thriller by director Brian De Palma. It does have a couple of slow moments and maybe it was a tad too long, but it's well compensated by superbly tense situations and blistering action sequences, especially in the first opening hour involving Douglas's character when his son is kidnapped and when his hiding out from government agents. There are also some scenes that are not recommended for the squeamish. As some scenes are filled with a lot of blood and more blood. It's rather graphic violence. Not to forgot the whooping and hearting-pounding conclusion. The make-up and special effects throughout the film are truly stunning. <br /><br />The plot basis is on psychokinetic powers and at times it's rather absurd and incoherent. With some incredibly cheesy moments within the dialogue. Though, the direction is what covers the story's inconsistencies, with great and simply memorable set-ups and some well-shot scenes. The music score is fairly effective in building up the tension and thrills, but also it has an impact in the quieter moments.<br /><br />There are great performances from the experienced Kirk Douglas (who's incredibly fit for his age and has some physical roles) and Cassavetes, who really boost and add some class to the film. There is such a great chemistry between them and Cassavetes is simply riveting as a conniving agent. Amy Irving was good in her role as Gillian Bellaver, the girl who is having trouble coming to grips with her strong psychokinetic powers. Though, the same can't be said about the rest. As Andrew Steven's as Robin Sandza is incredibly hammy and Carrie Snodgress as Hester is fairly irritating. <br /><br />I wouldn't class it as one of De Palma's best, but still it's far away from his worst.

Glaringly funny at points however it has fantastic intricacies you only catch the second time around (the old C4 logo needless detail but makes a massive difference).<br /><br />The only further comment i can give is ....WATCH IT!!!,unsup
10881_0,"This show is brilliant and so clever. On first glance it looks like a cheap spoof but the more you watch it the more details you notice. The film used is authentic 80's quality, there's a million tiny deliberate errors and the whole show is a brilliant stab at horror writers that take themselves way too seriously. There's recognisable bits of many a horror writer in there.<br /><br />The cast is fantastic and nearly every line is memorable and funny. What's really annoying though is that Ch4 did their usual balls up with the show. Because it won't sell overseas (see some of the comments from the colonies on this one) and because it's hard to categorise by dull marketing types the show got next to no advertising and was thrown on at something like 11pm on a Thursday evening. Viewing figures where therefore low and the dull marketing people could nod and feel they were right in not backing it in the first place.<br /><br />Seriously, it deserved a second series on the strength of it's one song alone! In these sad days when tripe like Three Pints of Lager and a Packet of Desperation gets 7/10 on here it's good to see original and very funny comedy, even if it doesn't last long.",unsup

Horrendous would be the best thing you could say about the story, dialogue and pretty much everything else about this.<br /><br />But before you run away, stay and watch just one episode and you'll see what a genius Matt Holness is and what a find this comedy is.<br /><br />10-4 (You'll get it after!)

10884_0,"Darkplace is absolutely fantastic!!! Some may not get it, but for the ones with a brilliant eye for comedy and attention to detail, this in my books has yet to be beat. I love the office (UK) but this just pips it at the post. So many subtle strokes of wit and genius are hidden under the mask of the pretend fake cheap sets etc.<br /><br />Little nuances of dialogue, and facial expressions that could be easily missed by the casual viewer. Amazing quotes, and the setting is so authentic.<br /><br />Some cool quotes...<br /><br />Padre to Dagless "" You're the most sensitive man i know. And I know god!"" Sanchez. ""Its egg in soup, serve that with a pork-pie/sausage roll."" Thornton reed"" And I've worked with Lulu! and 5 other people."" I have just realised that merely writing down these quotes will do little to prove its comedy. Its all about the delivery of the lines and the comedic timing. Every single line of dialogue uttered by Sanchez and his actor alter-ego Todd Rivers, is pure gold. I'm glad he made it into the rather weak ""IT crowd"" in series 2, he truly made that series worth watching. The brilliant music video played in episode 6 ""Red hot lover"" is worthy of recognition alone. It even beats the ""Rick rolled"" video of Rick Astley on the web. Hilarious! I truly hope that Darkplace gets a much needed second series. Man to man with dean learner was good, but it suffered a lack of Sanchez.<br /><br />I also read rumours that a movie of Darkplace was getting made.

10885_0,"What I love about British comedies is that they're always looking for something new. They're never content with repeating the same ideas under the guise of new actors and story lines. Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is one of those crazy new ideas. Richard Ayoade and Matthew Holness return to the '80s, look for everything that was bad in that decade's TV shows, for what was in need of a send up, and created this show which spoofs anything from A Team to Night Rider to Miami Vice.<br /><br />Garth Marenghi is a horror writer, a visionary, a dream weaver, or, as he puts it, an imaginer. He's really a mediocre novelist and a worse director and writer. But somehow he manages to get a TV show made with his publisher, Dean Learner, and actors Todd Rivers (the amazing Matt Berry) and Madeleine Wool (Alice Lowe). The show is awful, with corny plots, bad sfx, and a synth-heavy score typical of the time. Garth believes the show was so ahead of its time it could change the world. Unfortunately no channel bought it and Darkplace remained in his basement for nearly twenty years (except for a run in Peru).<br /><br />Decades later a channel decides to air the show. For this Garth adds a few interviews with himself and the crew. Many times they interrupt the action to comment on it. Obviously, these are the finer bits, with the serious way they discuss the show they made, incapable of realizing how poor it is.<br /><br />Alas, they only made six episodes. I can't understand why it didn't gain more popularity. The episodes are short and one will feel hungry for more. For this reason buying the DVD is a good idea. The crew created two extra interviews, each 30 minutes long, which are as amusing as any of the episodes and give a lot of insight into Garth, Dean, Todd and Madeleine's mysterious fate. This is the only DVD I've actually bothered to watch all the extras, they're all amazing and add a lot to the original show.<br /><br />Up there with the modern shows of its kind - The League of Gentlemen and The Mighty Boosh - this mix of humor and horror, of TV and movie spoofs is one of the most original and unforgettable shows made.",unsup
10886_0,"I just want to comment on what a burst of comic genius came out of 2004.

They all play on one another's projects now.<br /><br />I really hope to find out was it ""Darkplace"" which all gave them a foot in the door with a network. There has to be some big movies due out from these guys. Because in America we have just given up on film. All my horror films now come from Korea or somewhere west of Hawaii. Thank god the U.K. are still putting out something original.<br /><br />I have a DVD suggestion. If you are living outside of the states check out the DVD of a show called ""Sea Lab 2010"", ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" just check it out they are as strange and funny.<br /><br />Good night my Rottweiler is being very passive aggressive with me so now I have to go.

It didn't immediately appeal to me. However, about 1 year ago, my friend convinced me to give it another shot.<br /><br />When trying to describe how this show is produced, it is impossible not to contradict oneself. The point of this show is to laugh at the shoddy production, writing and acting. However, the way this show is acted, written and produced is, for me the best, the most observant, yet ridiculous, that I have ever seen on British comedy television. My favourite example of the writing has to be in episode 3, 'Skipper the eye child', when Rick Dagless m.d. (Garth Marenghi) says:<br /><br />You know what Sanch, you can dissect a heart, but you'll never know what makes it skip a beat<br /><br />This programme, for me is pure genius, because Matt Holness, has really nailed the genre on its head. This programme not only makes me think of and laugh about shoddy horror shows, or appalling writing, it also makes me think of the times that I thought that I was a talented writer when I was younger, and wrote lines similar to the one above, feeling very proud of myself.<br /><br />This show should not be missed, and if you were unsure about it the first time, give it another shot. You will not be disappointed. It comes second to Arrested Development for me, and that is the only show that I would ever rate 10/10.",unsup
10888_0,"(HEY!) I seriously can't believe how badly this series has been treated by Channel 4. A simple repeat and an early DVD release would have turned this show in to a huge success. (If only it wasn't cancelled for a re-run of Who's The Boss) This show is one of the extremely few shows I can watch over and over again, and it still remains funny. Scrap that, it gets funnier. (It is funny. It is funny. Oh my goodness, ohhhhh yessss) And just the fact it's shot on old 16mm gives the whole show a surreal epic production value to the thing whilst still maintaining the fact it was supposed to be shot on no money in a garage.<br /><br />It's not often you see a show where every line is a work of genius. You can skip to any part of any show and you'll instantly be at something hilarious. Me and my friends have had proper Darkplace tourrettes since we first saw this show, and it never gets old.<br /><br />I'm hoping people will still buy the DVD (When it comes.

10889_0,"""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" is another original and hilarious comedy show that could only have been made in Britain. It shares a lot of its random humour and imaginative story lines with ""The Mighty Boosh"". Appropriately, Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt have guest appearances here, the latter of which steals every single scene he's in. The whole cast is amazing, though. From Matthew Holness as the ridiculously narcissistic title character, Matt Berry (who might be a bit of a one trick pony, but really gives the performances of his life on this show) and the ever so underrated Richard Ayoade, who also directed and co-wrote the whole thing (which kind of makes him the real life Garth Marenghi, come to think of it). You won't see such great bad acting anywhere else.<br /><br />The show makes fun of Stephen King-like horror writers and cheaply made detective-, hospital- and horror-series all at the same time. What comes out is a weird mixture of doctor-cops who run around a cursed hospital with guns trying to deal with all sorts of spooky occurrences and creepy creatures (while having to deal with the burden of daily admin). Garth Marenghi himself calls it ""flat out, balls to the wall-horror"".<br /><br />Every single line, every bad editing cut, every cheap costume is a big laugh. From the music to the hair to the stupid story lines, the show is dead on in its observations of a typical weekly TV series from the late 70's and early 80's.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this kind of humour didn't seem to resonate too well with a mass audience, so another series is rather unlikely. That's too bad, because I'm sure they could have come up with another set of six fantastic episodes. As it is, the show is a hidden gem for those who get it and will become even more of a cult favourite over the next few years.",unsup

Whether it's cats being thrown out of doors, clumsy cuts to a woman with mascara smeared all over her face to show the upset she has just endured or terribly inept timing in the acting department, this movie feels like a real, low-budget product of the late-70s/early-80s.<br /><br />Matthew Holness deserves most of the praise for his writing and portrayal of the egomaniacal Garth himself but he wouldn't have a show without the superb support from Matt Berry (hilariously cool and cocky), Richard Ayoade (bravely portraying the worst actor of the bunch) and Alice Lowe (as the lovely Liz, a woman no less and ""I hope that's not a problem"").<br /><br />The script is a platinum-plated gem and every other line will have you stifling another big laugh.

10893_0,"Following in the vein of shows such as The Mighty Boosh, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is a show that clubs to death the genre of hospital drama with the Dean Learner's wooden acting.<br /><br />Each of the actors play two sets of characters. Matthew Holness plays horror novelist Garth Marenghi who penned a horror show called ""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" which was cancelled in the '80s but resurrected in the modern day. Marenghi plays the show's hero, the doctor with a tragic past, Rick Dagless. Richard Ayoade plays the show's producer Dean Learner, and the stereotypical ""boss"" Thornton Reed. Learner continuously claims he was effectively playing himself, which explains his shoddy acting. Matt Berry plays Rick's buddy, the womanizing Lucien Sanchez and Alice Woole as the dumb blonde with telekinetic powers, Liz Asher.<br /><br />Although featuring various horror elements, such as a baby eye, an ape with mutating urine and a spontaneous detonating man, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace's real appeal is in it's homage to bad television. Everything from the acting, to the editing, to the writing, to the music, to the special effects, to the white maverick aggravating his uptight black boss is all done to show up the godawful '80s shows shown only at eleven o'clock on weekdays.<br /><br />The show however is also a brilliant example of cult British sitcom. Unlike other shows such as The Mighty Boosh or The League of Gentlemen which spawned mass publicity, cult followings and travelling shows, Garth Marenghi only ran for one series and still survives due to its popularity among the fans.

The series is set in a hospital which is built upon a gateway to hell, which Garth Marenghi's character opened once a short while ago with a friend with a dubious background. That's about it for the plot without spoiling it. It is such a good parody, so accurate that it has the author who has ""written more books than he has read"" appears as the main character, writing, producing, and also having his best producer friend appear as the hard nosed hospital director (with disastrous consequences). There is a parody of everything in this from Brian De Palma's ""The Fury"" (I haven't ever blown up but I think I have a good idea what it's like!!?) to Phantasm (Except the flying orb is replaced with a rabid stapler(I'm serious it works)). This will not appeal to the masses but will be a big hit with the people that make cult hits, hits. The creators ARE the target audience so they know exactly what you want.

It's a take off of cheap 1980's horror/sci-fi shows such as Dr. Who with acting and sets that make crossroads seem like a big budget Hollywood production and with more cheese than an Emmenthal festival in Vienna. Matthew Holness has created a very dark macabre comedy , sometimes with disturbing scenes (the giant eyeball) but always excruciatingly funny ones (the giant eyeball).

The way they spoof the various 80's hospital dramas,actions shows, and blend them with some b-movie horror w/ some low budget sci-fi thrown in, is just amazing and works so well. The over-dramatics, the intentionally bad acting, the low budget look, and the interludes with the actors speaking about their vision for the show, blends into this comedic over the top, ridiculousness. Every line in this is either a hilarious well placed cliché, a silly premise, or utter silliness, all perfectly coming together to make a spoof piece that lampoons a variety of eighties shows and kept me entertained laughing out loud. It is also one of the most quotable shows ever. It is like the Spinal Tap of 80's television. The show is done so well, with every subtle little thing imaginable thrown in.

10901_0,"It's somewhat ironic that Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, a comedy about a long lost horror series re-emerging during a creative drought was overlooked on its release. The show didn't exactly set the ratings afire when it was aired, but it is tailor made for DVD where all the intricacies can be appreciated. The writing abilities of creators Richard Ayaode and Matthew Holness are on top form throughout, the pair showing a talent for sly humour and witty invention. Like the equally strong but in no way similar Peep Show, Darkplace is a program that can be watched multiple times and still remain as fresh and hilarious as it did first time around, how many American sitcoms can boast that claim?<br /><br />The series follows a show-within-another-show format. Holness plays Garth Marenghi, a leather clad purveyor of trash horror novels very much in the James Herbert mould. Back in the eighties, he wrote, directed and starred in 'Darkplace,' a hospital-set sci fi/horror series so disturbing, so terrifying, that the powers that be consigned it to the vaults where it sat gathering dust for nearly two decades, only to be returned to the screen in 2004. The episodes however are incomplete, with huge chunks of footage missing and so to make up the running time, Marenghi, his producer/co-star Dean Learner (Richard Ayaode) and fellow actor Todd Rivers (Matt Berry) have had interviews recorded, snippets of which make up the gaps.<br /><br />The end result is a fantastic parody of eighties trash television. The sets are wobbly, the violence over the top, the acting stilted, the scripts hackneyed and the editing haphazard (Dean Learner has a blood stained spade magically appear in his hand in one particularly memorable incident). Consequently, the humour does not stem from jokes but instead from the terrible production and acting, as well as Marenghi's misguided belief that he has created a timeless masterpiece.<br /><br />If the show has a highlight however, it is undoubtedly Richard Ayaode's dual role as Producer Dean Learner and Darkplace boss Thornton Reed. His inability to read his lines and interact with another cast member at the same time is hilarious and his behaviour becomes increasingly outlandish as the series goes on. His improv skills seem to have been allowed to run riot throughout and while the majority of his lines aren't necessarily funny, when they're delivered in Ayaode's distinctive voice, they become side splitting.<br /><br />When it all comes down to it though, no amount of words can really describe what Darkplace is like, it's a show you have to experience first hand. Anyone raised on eighties television shows like Deathwatch or the original Doctor Who will find plenty to chew on and it's even worth watching with the commentaries switched on. Holness, Berry and Ayaode remain in character for every single one and the result is the funniest DVD commentary since Spinal Tap. Very highly recommended indeed.",unsup

I was a bit concerned after the first episode that the jokes would quickly wear a bit thin but this hasn't proved to be the case.

The 'bad acting', or 'showing the truth' as Garth puts it, is amazingly funny. This is especially true in the character of Garth's boss and the chef (The Office's Stephan Merchant).

10909_0,"Hospital horror Dark Place is the creation of awful writer Garth Marenghi (Matthew Holness), who wrote, directed and starred. He claims it is deep and inspirational, when in fact it is just shoddy and awful.<br /><br />Darkplace isn't joke orientated, its the terrible production and acting that provides all the laughs, that mainly come from Garth's publisher, Dean Learner (Richard Ayocade) who plays the hospital boss Thornton Reed. His inability to do two things at once when it comes to acting (for example deliver a line and hang up a phone) is hilarious to watch. <br /><br />Some of the highlights include a ""dirt bike"" chase through a forest (using tiny children's bicycles), a doctor being attacked by a steam iron and another being chased by a possessed stapler, a woman turning into broccoli and Dean Learner trying to justify how he punched a child actor. However, you have to see it to realize how funny it really is, my words can't do enough. <br /><br />Darkplace won't appeal to everyone's tastes, but still it looks like it will probably be a cult hit. If its ever repeated, its worth a look just to see what you think. It provides a refreshing change from awful reality TV and soap operas.<br /><br />I, for one, can't wait for the DVD and/or a second batch of episodes ""from the Channel 4 vaults"".

Movie sounds pretty good so far but wait.<br /><br />It seems that having sex is one of the primary roles of this software and the characters themselves including the main characters and after setting up the story everything starts falling apart and the storyline that could be good gets ground to a halt.<br /><br />I don't know how Ian Ziering's agent could have ever approved of this career ending part.

10911_0,"I caught this film on Turner Classic Movies and it kept my interest throughout the entire movie. It was my first viewing of an Italian postwar piece, and I was quite impressed. The only noted actor in the film was Steiger, and his performance certainly was not his best, but the movie was still very good. Overall, I thought that it reflected the futility of war through the struggles of these three characters very well, inserting comedy where appropriate. The Soldier and the Girl had several great, very funny scenes interacting with each other, and the comedy of the movie, though hard to place in a somewhat depressing war movie, actually worked very well. A hard-to-find but worthy film.",unsup
10912_0,"This film will unfortunately not be remembered for Rod Steiger's performance. There are very few films that Steiger has not dominated--this is one of them. It will be remembered for the story and the direction, an interesting performance by Virna Lisi, and a somewhat creditable score by Ennio Morricone. <br /><br />The director, Pasquale Festa Campanile, one should should recall has written scripts for and collaborated with great Italian directors such as Pasolini and Visconti. I do not know much more about Campanile but he must have been very good at writing screenplays for Visconti to work with him on 'The Leopard' which is not an easy novel by any consideration. According to the opening credits in the English version of the film ""The Girl and the General,"" the director is one of the two authors of the original story--a fact missed out by the IMDb's current details on the webpage for the film.<br /><br />This is not a war film. It is film that uses war as a backdrop to evaluate human values and what money means to the wretched and the poor. A bumbling soldier played convincingly by Umberto Orsini captures a General, not for heroics, not by design but by mere chance. The soldier is illiterate while the General is an understandably a well-read individual. Thus the Geneva convention and the city that Julius Caesar built is of little significance to the soldier. Yet, what is significant for him is the fact that few Generals die in the war front and what the soldiers were given to drink before they clashed with the enemy at the front and met their death. <br /><br />Neorealistic Italian cinema used the post-War scenario to examine study the human condition. Hunger is a great leveller: the General and soldier are the same when they are hungry. The soldier grudgingly shares his food with the General; the General steals a frog caught by the soldier. The writer-director clearly states where his sympathies lie. The soldier as an honest individual may appear stupid, but earns the respect of the viewer with his tenacity to come up with great ideas of making a General look like a cow to gain a few hours of sleep. His use of the word ""Sir"" to address his prisoner over the length of the movie is a fine aspect of the character build-up by the writer.<br /><br />The film moves into top gear with the arrival of the illiterate girl played by Virna Lisi. For her, too, taking the captured General back is simply for the the 1000 Lire split between two individuals that will allow for a good life. Her character is benign, honest and rustic. For a few potatoes she bares her breasts and the humiliation of the act is wonderfully portrayed without histrionics.<br /><br />The sexual arousal of the soldier, the importance of sleep over the need for sex, the urinating General whose one arm is useless are vignettes of superb cinema. The simplicity of the film, as in most neo-realist Italian cinema, is disarming. The film even goes on to make a hero of a donkey, while conversation revolves around tasty donkey-meat.<br /><br />The film reverses the traditional concept of heroism by presenting a woman being superior to a man (the General), a honest foot soldier superior to a General.<br /><br />I am surprised the film has been glossed over by casual viewers. I will be looking out to catch up with Campanile's work. I am pleased to note that Virna Lisi has finally been accepted as a serious actress in the Nineties for her work in ""La Reigne Margot"". <br /><br />Ennio Morricone's score in this film is very close to the music he provided for the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone. His score like the performance of Steiger is reigned in by the director to emphasize the role of the soldier and the girl. My only problem with the title of the movie is the lack of importance provided to the soldier, who is the central figure.<br /><br />When I saw the film, the film brought back memories of de Sica's ""Bicycle Thief"". This film, which provides equal importance to hens and donkeys as it does to human characters, is as real as they come and yet so removed from the values of Hollywood's screenplays, then and now.",unsup

Lucky for me. This was my first real exposure to the wonderful explosion of realism in Italian cinema from the '60's. <br /><br />The movie does a wonderful job of depicting war as something that happens during peoples' lives, not vice versa. Rather than the defining element of the time, its another element in of life, where people fear, and hope, and struggle.<br /><br />Wonderfully acted, good cinematography (as long as you remember that this is realism), and decent editing. Full of humor and pathos.",unsup
10914_0,"This is a small gem, apparently totally forgotten and ignored by the multitudes of clueless movie fans and critics, who are very much focused on showering praise only on crap that they dig out from the past. I was surprised to find myself enjoying an Italian movie. The humour is slightly odd, at times very funny. There are those who consider Steiger not to be at his best here, but I guess for some people only frantic over-acting, complete with manic hand-waving and mugging, counts as good acting. (""Show mee the moneeeyyyy!""). Steiger is subtle yet everything he does that is in any way connected to escaping his dumb captors is hilarious: the way he touches the soldier's rifle, the manner in which he dashes away with the cow bell attached to his neck... Priceless. TGATG is strange little film, almost inventing a new sub-genre: the ""war road movie"". The trio of main characters move in war-torn territory that comes off almost as another planet, where food is about as scarce as brain-cells are in Sean Penn's bloated head. The struggle for the egg is a good example. The guy playing the Italian soldier isn't that great, but Virna Lisi is quite sexy. The fairly interesting Morricone score helps, too.",unsup

10916_0,"I found this in a second-hand shop that had a VCR and TV to preview the used tapes. From the bizarre opening shot of the oil field and the director's credit, I knew this was one worth the dollar.<br /><br />Franco Nero does his best Terrence Hill impression as the character Onion who arrives in town to start an onion farm on a parcel of land he's bought real cheap from a farmer. What he doesn't know is that evil oil magnate Petrus Lamb has bought/stolen all the property around the town due to the vast oil reserves under the town. Lamb has a strange mechanical hand that's serviced by Adolf Hitler! Thru a plot device out of Once Upon A Time in the West, Onion's property is still owned by the orphans of the original farmer who's been killed by Lamb's henchmen. The rest of the movie revolves around the increasingly silly attempts to steal the lease out of Onion's possession.<br /><br />First of all, the film is very well directed by Enzo Castellari so that already lifts it out of the typical spaghetti western doldrums. The script is very silly with frequent forays into total surrealism. Onion fights with a gun and the many onions that he has hidden in his pants. During a duel he always asks, ""Gun or Onion?"" The first fight scene with Onion is right out of the first Trinity movie except it mostly done with onions. I suppose it's a parody of sorts, but how do you parody a parody? Martin Balsam is game as the evil Lamb and he seems to be having fun with the mechanical hand he's wearing. I enjoyed the movie for the most part although the overuse of sped-up footage towards the end is a let-down. The English dubbing crew had some fun with this film as they gave Onion a Jimmy Stewart voice and one orphan sounds like Bugs Bunny imitating a gangster. For some reason it works! I wonder what the Italian original sounds like.<br /><br />Not the greatest but with enough bright spots that I enjoyed the film.",unsup

That´s when the fun begins. I´d like to remark from this film the surrealistic details it contains such as the nazi look of the villains, the capacity of our hero ""Franco Nero"" eating and even drinking! raw onions.<br /><br />If you have the chance to watch it, just do it. I believe you won´t be disappointed.<br /><br />It seems as the couple Franco Nero / Enzo G. Castellari always made good films...

""You think I'm small town?"" ""I think Bomont's a small town."" ""I'm going' away...I'm gonna be gone... Wanna see somethin'?"" Listen to the background music as this scene unfolds. The violin, piano and soulful rock guitar are wed beautifully. Miles Goodman adapted the score so I'm giving him credit for this still mega-emotion stirring theme music. Then, as Ren tells the town ""This is our time to dance,"" well, it still brings a tear of joy and hope. And the background music gives Kevin Bacon's character a rock to stand upon as he gives his speech. Then, there are the snowcapped mountains and sweeping farm valleys that drew me in. The kids, the story, the religious oppression (I'm truly from the Bible Belt where there are no snowcapped mountains) and most of the music all make this film one that I will watch until I'm old and gray, and no longer have the strength to say ""I'm gonna be gone.""

So much fun to learn about the creative process by which this went from being one man's idea to being a cultural phenomenon.

10927_0,"As those of you who know me from the message boards will know, I will have a place in my heart for this movie. On March 10th of this year, I attended my high school's production of the Broadway musical version of ""Footloose"", and loved it. It was one of the best nights of this school year so far (for reasons I should not go into too much detail here). Still, it took about five and a half weeks before I could see the movie on which the musical was based.<br /><br />The plot, for those of you really want it: Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) is a Chicago kid who moves to the small Indiana town of Bomont, where the local priest, Shaw Moore (John Lithgow), has outlawed rock music and dancing (due to the death of his son in a car accident). After turning the local kids (including Lori Singer, Chris Penn, and Sarah Jessica Parker) onto the tunes of Kenny Loggins, Ren decides it's time to change the town's rules about dancing. Meanwhile, Moore grows increasingly sympathetic towards Ren, due to his daughter (Singer)'s feelings towards him, and his being the target of abuse by the local bully (Jim Youngs) and the overly-conservative town council. Does Ren win his fight? What do you think? <br /><br />Overall, this movie conformed to how I thought it would turn out: it was completely silly, but fun and an entertaining waste of a day off from school. The music was great (though certain songs were hardly used, namely my favorite, ""Somebody's Eyes""), and is alone worth watching it for. The only excessively silly scene is Ren's gymnastic routine in an empty flour mill, which made me laugh my butt off at how stupid it was. Other than that, however, nothing was wrong with this movie, which was successful at what it set out to do: entertain. Just because it isn't ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" doesn't mean it's a bad film.<br /><br />The cast was good if unspectacular. Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker (whom I almost didn't recognize!) were solid and it's easy to see why most of them went on to become stars; they look like they're having fun throughout and are very convincing. But John Lithgow walks away with the acting prize for this film; his character is surprisingly complex and well-developed for a film of this type, and it's to Lithgow's credit that he was able to make Shaw Moore a sympathetic character.<br /><br />Is ""Footloose"" a great film? No. Is it one I'll want to watch over and over again? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes. And, as I said, for the sake of all of my friends at school who were in their production of it, I will ALWAYS think fondly of ""Footloose"".<br /><br />I'll give ""Footloose"" a warm seven stars. I don't know what more to say on here, except I hope I get to see the musical version again (and not as the proposed film remake!).",unsup

10930_0,"Let's first admit that this movie is not some deep drama or social commentary. It may have a good message, but it isn't shoved down your throat. In the end it is just a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />Having said that, this is one of my favorite movies because of that good message and, more importantly, because of the way in which it is presented. Countless movies and books have been centered on the basic theme of this movie - namely the intergenerational friction between teens and their parents. Unfortunately, most of them fall into the same trap and paint one (or both) sides as stereotypical in the extreme. Frequently this shows up by having kids that are ultra-clever battling against bumbling adults (Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off - both of which are enjoyable - come immediately to mind, but the list is oh so long). Usually, the kids have no apparent concrete reason to be battling the adults and the adults merely want to be obeyed because they are adults - they don't appear to have any desire to actually do what's best for the kids. In the end, these tales usually have the kids triumphing over the adults.<br /><br />Footloose largely avoids this. At first, it appears that the adults in town are going to turn out to be cardboard cutouts transplanted from all the other movies in the genre, but it quickly turns out that the adults are not evil, nor stupid, nor uncaring. They are genuinely trying to do what they believe is best for their kids - and they realize that they aren't infallible and that they don't have all the answers. In the end they are willing to consider change not because they are convinced the changes are necessarily right, but because they respect and trust their kids.<br /><br />For their part, the kids aren't rebelling just to rebel, nor are they trying to deny their parent's authority even as they struggle against it. Quite the opposite, they largely work within the bounds of the system their parents have set up in their quest to change it - and their parents. They do so because they respect and trust their parents. Furthermore, they are willing to accept defeat when it appears their best efforts didn't win the day.<br /><br />What this film portrays so well is that parents and their children may have different outlooks and priorities and they may come into passionate conflict as a result - but they can do so while the mutual love, trust, and respect endures.",unsup

As soon as I finished watching the movie again, I watched it again with Kevin Bacon's commentary and then again with the commentary of the writer and producer.<br /><br />Most of the commentary is just of the he/she is really great variety. However, there are a couple of amazing revelations. First, Herbert Ross, the director, had to fight for Kevin Bacon against the studio. Apparently, Tom Cruise was scheduled to star, but there was a scheduling conflict. Ross forced Bacon to do a screen test and showed it to the studio execs. If they hadn't come around, he would have walked off the picture and that would have been the end of it. Fortunately, the screen test worked. The second big revelation is that Ross originally had a very low key ending with no real dancing in the final dance sequence. It was only when test audiences gave the film thumbs down that he finally agreed to shoot the upbeat final dance number. Fortunately, he was flexible enough to make the change, so we get a terrific ending and one of the greatest and most fun dance movies of all time.<br /><br />The chemistry between Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer is terrific and Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker are both great in their sidekick, comedian roles. Diane Wiest gets lost, but John Lithgow is amazingly effective as the regressive, but intelligent preacher.<br /><br />Along with Grease and Dirty Dancing, this is one of the three greatest musical/dancing movies of the 1980's.",unsup

It's . . . it's . . . it's . . . . well, it COULD just be a decent little movie.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon plays the young lad who moves into a small town and is both disgusted and angered to learn that it doesn't allow any real music or dancing. The reason for this comes out as the story unfolds but, suffice to say, it's up to Bacon and the kids (some of them played by the likes of Chris Penn, Lori Singer and Sarah Jessica Parker) to butt heads with the local enforcers of these rules and to particularly pit themselves against a local preacher (a stellar turn from John Lithgow).<br /><br />Yes, there are dollops of cheese in this film (especially Lori Singer's bratty, rebellious turn and the likes of Bacon's ""angry"" dance scene) but you may just be as surprised as I was to find how well most of it has stood the test of time. Whether it's the toe-tapping soundtrack featuring that titular classic from Kenny Loggins, the chicken race, the sight of Chris Penn learning to dance or just great, great scenes between John Lithgow and the superb Dianne Wiest . . you'll find that there's still a LOT here to enjoy.<br /><br />See this if you like: Kevin Bacon, Hairspray, Flashdance.",unsup
10936_0,"It's easy to take a quick glance at this movie & compare it to other teen flicks or dance flicks like Dirty Dancing, but it's much deeper than that.It's about conflicts such as religion & morality and how a small midwest town can take it too far. It's about the struggle of teens for freedom & the difficulty parents have letting go of their children.<br /><br />The film centers around a town, which led by its preacher (Lithgow) has banned dancing, music & alcohol. The more the town represses the teens, the more they seem to want to rebel & Ren (Bacon), an outsider becomes their leader.<br /><br />Most people like this movie because of Kevin Bacon & the great soundtrack.

Ren revolts with best friend Willard (Chris Penn) and the minister's daughter (Lori Singer).""

In a way cool haircut, Mr. Bacon and his stunt doubles perfectly accompany a terrific soundtrack. He and the young supporting cast have, in hindsight, the kind of chemistry casting directors can't manufacture; they're fun and unforced. Introduced like the prerequisite stupid adults, John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest get to add more depth than you'd expect.

Bacon is Ren, the new kid in a town that doesn't allow dancing, and he sets out to change that.<br /><br />That's actually about all there is to the plot, except that Ren gets involved with pretty Ariel, the daughter of the preacher (John Lithgow). Ariel likes to play chicken with things like trains and cars. In fact, all these kids have hormones, impulses, and energy that are in desperate need of an outlet.<br /><br />""Footloose"" has one of the best soundtracks ever, and some wonderful dancing. Despite its serious moments, it has a relentlessly upbeat and exuberant feel to it. Herb Ross directed; originally, it was supposed to be Michael Cimino. It certainly would have been a different film with him directing. Take ""Footloose"" for what it is, don't ask for ""Citizen Kane,"" and you'll love it.",unsup

10940_0,"Back in 1984, when 'Footloose' came out, dance movies were very popular. After the success of 1970's productions, like 'Saturday Night Fever', everyone was trying to get some in the 1980's. That's where the problem began. Every dance movie that came out, you already knew what was going to happen, what is it about, etc. And with 'Footloose', is no different.<br /><br />This movie tells the story of Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon), a boy from Chicago that moves to a small town. There, while falling in love with the Reverend's daughter (Lori Singer), he finds out that there is a law against dancing in this town(!), now he tries to organize a dancing ball for his class and fights against his law. From this, you already know what's going to happen, and it's really boring. The plot is really absurd, if it was set in the 1950's, it would be believable. At least the movie has a few sub-plots, but none of them is interesting or gets your attention, they are all cliché and predictable. <br /><br />By in the middle of it, I kept thinking ""If this a dance movie, why a plot? What about the dancing?"". And that's where lies the problem of the movie. A dance movie with no dancing! The soundtrack is excellent with great original songs like 'Footloose' and 'Let's hear it from the boy', but you don't get to see anyone dancing in the most of the movie. Instead, what you get are bad-made dialogs and a non-believable story.<br /><br />The acting here is ridiculous. Kevin Bacon looks more like a gay alien and nothing else, and Lori Singer isn't beautiful at all. Thankfully, the movie has John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest, and they really saved the movie. They are both excellent as the Reverend and his wife. The other aspects aren't even worth mentioning, but Herbert Ross' directing really bothered me with close-ups of people's feet.<br /><br />Overral, this is a really bad dance movie. The direction bothers you, and the two leads don't act their ways out. But the nice soundtrack and original songs, as well as John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest made the movie watchable. It's better then 'Flashdance', what doesn't say much, but it's nothing compared to better dance movies, like 'Saturday Night Fever'<br /><br />3/10",unsup

10942_0,"I used to LOVE this movie, and I remember I got the soundtrack for Easter when I was like, 11 or something. It really is a crummy movie, but oddly engaging... mainly because it is so incredibly surreal and laughable in how it takes itself so seriously.<br /><br />*Possible Spoilers*<br /><br />I remember even as a kid, I thought ""Holy cow, for a town that didn't allow dancing and music for years, these kids sure can dance well."" What are even funnier are the people who are in it - Lithgow did this film two years after Garp. Did he think that this was going to be a meaty role? But then again, he did willingly star in Third Rock from the Sun. And Dianne Wiest - Woody Allen staple and Oscar winner, who has about 4 lines in the movie. Her job is to pretty much look pensive and pious. I don't think I even need to bring up Mr. Kevin Bacon and his goofy dance through the grain mill.<br /><br />While this film is not as inherently horrible as say, Xanadu, it's also not nearly as hilarious because it takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously. Of course, it has its moments, especially the part where the dance is beginning and no one is dancing. Why? Let's pretend it's not because Kevin Bacon isn't there in his stupid outfit to scream ""Let's Daaaaaaaance!!!!!!!!"", (rather, is outside getting his ass beat down by the head redneck until he somehow manages to pull out of it and kick said redneck's ass. How the hell did THAT happen?) But in reality because the song playing is the Loverboy guy and Ann Wilson's ""Almost Paradise."" I think that as kids if we were sexually oppressed and sheltered and that song came on we wouldn't have danced to that crap song either. Yes, this was the 80's, and mid-80's to boot so the clothes, dancing and dialogue are hilariously dated. These kids must have somehow obtained pirate copies of Radio Free Solid Gold Dancers or something, especially the skinny white kid doing ""The Robot"".<br /><br />This movie is up there with 80's `classics' like `Flashdance' where we find that while most of us loved the movie as kids, we see it through adult eyes twenty years later and realize what our parents probably thought: `What a crap movie.' The difference being, our nostalgia sometimes compels us to avoid averting our eyes, like a train wreck.<br /><br />--Shelly",unsup
10943_0,"EVERYBODY CUT FOOTLOOSE As we all know 1984 produced a lot of great things. One of the best was ""Footloose"". Here's my thoughts on this timeless masterpiece which I brought on DVD this week<br /><br />-Most good movies have a great opening and Footloose is no exception. A bunch of feet dancing showcasing the great footwear of the 80's to the soundtrack song ""Footloose"". Immediately gets you in -Kevin Bacon's character has one of the all-time great movie names: ""Ren McCormack"" -Funny how this is probably Kevin Bacon's greatest role, maybe only challenged by ""Flatliners"". It's amazing how so many actors never repeat their efforts of their first breakthrough movie (See Lou Diamond Phillips, Chris Rock and Madonna for starters) -Also starring in this movie is one of Hollywood's greatest lesser known brothers, Sean Penn's brother Christopher. He's way better than Dan Swayze or Charlie Murphy. -Kenny Loggins will go down as one of the greatest contributors to movie hit songs ever. Footloose's ""Footloose"" and Top Gun's ""Danger Zone"". -This is another one of those movies built around a town's overzealous pastor's. Reverand Shaw (John Lithgow) is even more intense than that guy in ""Chocolat"" -Great action scene at the start with Lori Singer car surfing (watch the slightly impossible way she gets back in the car) -Also look for the great David Hasselhoff 2 second cameo -Great scene where the Rev turns off Lor Singer's ghetto-blaster. Everyone stops talking, eating and dancing. Possibly slightly dramatic -Will (Christopher Penn) tells us several other towns have also banned dancing. How wasn't that fact used as the premise for heaps more sequels with Ren going from town to town and reviving dance? Each time he'd face a new obstacle. -Ren mentions his love for ""Men at Work"" and ""The Police"", yet he only listens in his car to bad 80's electric rock. Strange. -Weird town. Here a face off equals a tractor fight. -One of the funniest moments is when Chuck gets onto his tractor and puts ""I need a hero"" on on his ghetto-blaster. That would be awesome to do at a basketball game when you sub in. -Another great Dianne Weist performance. That girl can just capture the whole audience when she wants. Underrated actress. -""Moment I regret now""- Christopher Penn's dance sequence to ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" (although it's a great sequence in the movie) -Kevin Bacon's speech to the council was possibly the greatest speech up until that time in cinema history. That is until Sly Stallone raised the bar with his ""If I Can Change...."" in Rocky 4. Which was then overtaken by Matthew McConaghuey's ""Can you see her..."" speech in ""A Time To Kill""",unsup
10944_0,"A film of enormous charm. It's about dancing but unlike many films about dancing it doesn't take itself seriously. It's loose-limbed and goofy and it lifts you up. It's set in a high school in a small mid-western town where dancing has been banned; (it reminds me of a joke I heard here in Ulster; 'Why do Free Presbyterians disapprove of making love standing up?' 'It might lead to dancing').<br /><br />Kevin Bacon is the new kid in town who wants the ban lifted. Indeed, this boy seems to live to dance and he's immensely likable. He uses his killer smile to great effect. In this movie the dancing is integral to the plot and it evolves from it naturally and, for once, the director Herbert Ross takes things easy. As well as Bacon, the film has Lori Singer, (the obligatory love interest), and John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest as her parents. He's the bible-thumper who thinks that dancing is sinful and Wiest, with her wan, other-worldly smile, is the wife who doesn't as well as a very young Chris Penn as the over-weight farm boy Bacon teaches to dance in a wonderful sequence choreographed to Denise Williams' 'Let's hear it for the boy'",unsup

10947_0,"Teenager Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves to a small mid Western town with his mom after his parents divorce. It seems the Reverend Moore (John Lithgow), of the town's only church, has totally banned rock and roll music from the entire town. He has a daughter named Ariel (Lori Singer) who is basically a hell-raiser--yet loves her father. Rem decides to stop the ban and bring the town back to life.<br /><br />OK--we're not dealing with reality here at ALL! A town banning rock music entirely is ridiculous and the town only has ONE church? And the game of chicken using tractors was just silly. And don't get me started on how Bacon, Singer, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker look WAY too old to be high school students--Singer was THIRTY when she did this! And how the heck did all the kids from the town learn how to dance so quickly? But, as a no brain musical, this does work.<br /><br />The opening sequence alone is great (it shows various feet dancing to the title tune). Also the acting helps a lot. Bacon is just great--he doesn't take the movie too seriously and gives out a very good performance. He also has a big dance number (to a song called ""Never"") which is him and THREE different stuntman doing the more unrealistic moves. Singer is too old for her role but she tries. Penn is pretty good as Bacon's best friend--his learning how to dance sequence is a highlight. Parker did this before she was known and she's not bad. Lithgow and Wiest are just great as the Reverend and his wife--Wiest has a great scene where she calmly tells him off and Lithgow (wisely) does not play the Reverend as a one-note character. You see him trying to understand his daughter and slowly realizing that music isn't bad.<br /><br />So--this is no ""Singin in the Rain"" but for a 1980s teen musical it's lots of fun. Great songs too. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!",unsup
10948_0,"Prior to seeing this movie, all I had heard suggested that I was better off not watching it unless it was to ridicule. I looked at my uncle dancing round his living room to some of its music and asked myself if anybody expected me to take that seriously. It's got a place in movie history even for the title song alone, though, so I decided I couldn't live with myself unless I gave it a chance. It was definitely worth it.<br /><br />The style is reminiscent of a whole host of other '80's teen flicks, but only a handful are better. Most of the cast do great things with their roles. Kevin Bacon actually manages to make the clichéd concept seem kinda cool, here showcasing an easy charm that was to become the hallmark of much of his later work. Crucially, the music is actually pretty good too! (Even if I am torn between wanting to cringe and dance when I hear the theme!)<br /><br />On reflection it's no cheesier than something like ""All the Right Moves"" (which has a great cast doing their best but suffers from a plodding story) In fact, it's miles better! At least the music in ""Footloose"" gave the makers a viable way to pep things up whenever the story begins to flag. This film is much, MUCH better than I had been led to believe, so give it a chance if you ain't seen it yet but thought you knew the score. Chances are, you don't...",unsup
10949_0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Picked this up on video and again am impressed with Edward Burns' (""The Brothers McMullen"") keen eye and ability to capture everyday frustration. Wonderful ensemble cast including a quirky, tanned, womanizing Dennis Farina. David Krumholtz does his best Woody Allen imitation, but Rosario Dawson and Brittany Murphy (""Don't Say A Word"") steal their scenes. The quasi-documentary style is effective most of the time, but we do get way too much Stanley Tucci, although his role plays right into his difficult to like persona. Krumholtz has the best one-liners and makes a nice transition form irritating ex-husband to head-over-heels boyfriend. Director Burns explores how every relationship is driven by sex - even the relationships where no sex exists. This is somewhat of an overstatement but it serves him well in making his point. Burns is a decent actor, but I question is range. As a director, I love his eye.",unsup

This is an excellet film with and excellent cast that really is a joy to watch.<br /><br />Although this is a great movie, there were a couple of things that I would have changed. The subject matter can get a bit redundant and and also the interviews can to. But that is just nit-picking. This is a great film that is worth renting whether you are a girl or a guy. This film really sparked my interest and even though I did not agree with some choices that were made in the end, I really liked this movie.",unsup
10952_0,"I hate Ed Burns. I think Rosario Dawson could go back to acting school. I have always felt a nervous twitch come on whenever Brittany Murphy speaks (like fingernails on a chalkboard). Then, alas, Heather Graham is only worth watching when directed by either PT Anderson or by early David Lynch. So, with a line up like this, I thought this would be a simple, and rather disappointing, film to view. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sidewalks of New York captured my attention with its unique storytelling ability, the quickness of the character development, and the underused talent that Stanley Tucci brought to this project. I also believe that what me enjoy this film further than I have other Edward Burns films (i.e. I HATED The Brothers McMullen) is that it wasn't your typical Ed Burns film. It was obvious, from the opening scene that he was the center focus, but it just didn't have the typical Ed Burns feel to it. This film felt fresh, not so ""in your New York face"" or centered on ethnicity as the others have, but instead about romance, sex, relationships, and personal responsibility. For me, Sidewalks worked because the characters worked together. This wasn't just Ed Burns focusing the camera on himself, but allowing others to speak around him. It felt like a conversation with Ed Burns and his friends, not just Ed Burns. Also, how can you disrespect a film where Stanley Tucci gives a phenomenal performance (completely taking away the Burns spotlight)! <br /><br />Pulled from an earlier release date because of 9/11, this film couldn't have made you feel more at home in New York than actually being there in person. I mentioned before that Burns fantastically takes the viewer away from you typical New York scenery and plants you IN New York (if that makes sense). He doesn't overpower you with the cliché images of the Empire State building, the Statue of Liberty, or other overblown New York images, but instead makes you feel like you actually live there. Burns, surprisingly, didn't develop the city as I assumed he would, but instead developed our characters. Burns' decision to make this film into a half-documentary, half-feature film was brilliant. New York is a fast pace town, and Burns captures that with his choice of direction. He jumps us quickly between characters, witnessing how fast a relationship can blossom in the city that never sleeps. One would normally think that this would be confusing, but for me, it kept me glued to the screen. Cylindrical story lines? Wasn't this technique so  yesterday? Perhaps, but Burns is able to keep the flow moving and the characters fun, which cannot be found in most of the knock-offs post-Magnolia. I believe that for one of the first times, Burns demonstrated his directing chops extremely well. He went outside of his norm, while keeping with the patented Burns seal of approval.<br /><br />When I first began this film I was upset with the choice of actors. It was obvious that Burns chose his friends to star in this film. Budget was tight and time was short, so why not. I have no trouble with this. My trouble is that his friends do not appeal to me as a film watcher. I have not seen (outside of Sin City in which Rosario and Brittany were animated) a worth wile film with a majority of our lead characters. Heather Graham flip-flops between decent and poor, while Brittany just seems like she isn't acting, but instead just playing ""herself"". I wasn't interested in the characters when I started this film, I just wanted to see how Burns would handle mediocre talent. I must admit, he surprised me. While Murphy, Graham, and Dawson were not ""jump-for-joy"" amazing, they worked well together. The script worked with these characters. There wasn't big shoes to fill, and I think even the low rung of the Hollywood ladder could handle this story, which kept me at ease. What really impressed me was that Tucci was jaw dropping. It was nothing that he would in an award for, but definitely the stand out talent of the film. For some very strange reason, he captivated me in this movie. I wasn't expecting the performance to be that good. I know, many of you think that this was a poor film, how could anyone's talent be that good? My thought is that Tucci stood out because nobody else was reaching the bar. The acting wasn't bad, it just felt sterile, but with Tucci that all changed. He kept Sidewalks of New York from sinking deep into the cinephile lagoon.<br /><br />Was this a movie about sex or relationships? That is the ultimate question to ask yourself as you watch Burns' comedy/drama. It is a question I asked myself as I watched it, so I want you to ask it as well. Sex is the topic of choice, but I think what makes Burns' film stand aside of the others is that it deals with honest relationships. This isn't just your typical boy falls for girl, but girl doesn't want boy relationships. This film is more about the truthfulness of individuals and the passion they evoke. I liked the stories that Burns wove together for me. This wasn't top shelf cinema, but it did entertain. Burns stories that he wrote were comical, yet exciting at the same time. We felt for these characters (even if they were not played well by the actors  outside of Tucci) and loved the city that they inhabited. This film reminded me of watching Sex & the City. That television program was exciting to me because of the city and because you believe anything can happen in that city. Love can be found in video stores, coffee shops, and real-estate visits. <br /><br />Call me genuinely sappy, but Sidewalks of New York deserves a second viewing.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****",unsup

This is just not the sort of film that it is possible to watch, without squirming in your seat.

10954_0,"When actor/director Edward Burn's The Brothers McMullan was released back in 1995, the critics likened it to a Woody Allen comedy. Now it seems that Mr Burns has brazenly gone one step further and remade Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1992) with slight plot changes and a younger cast of characters and of course an alternate title. Somehow this rewrite fails to capture the zany spark of the original, which is an excellent movie (try watching both movies back to back). Perhaps the only noteworthy thing about this movie are the performances: Rosario Dawson is excellent as the teacher who gets pregnant after a one night stand. As a matter a fact, her performance is the only thing that redeems this movie, since all the other characters are caught up in full Woody Allen film mimicry mode, some perhaps unintentionally. It's a shame that Mr Burns didn't run with the pregnant-after-a-one-night-stand plot thread as he might have turned out a movie of more merit and certainly one of more originality. 4/10 for effort minus 2 for borrowing heavily from another director.

10957_0,"If you're tired of romantic comedies with happy endings where the two lovers walk off into the sunset, then ""Sidewalks of New York"" will be a relief. The characters are perfectly realistic, and so are their situations. There's no scenes where characters fall in love in 2 minutes and break up in 2 minutes. The dialogue is very interesting, but it's not flashy. They talk the way real people talk. The movie is a voyeuristic glimpse into the lives of these real New Yorkers (they're really actors, but they seem completely real). The humor is funny, but not forced. There's even a good deal of sex jokes, but they're all done in good taste. The acting is terrific. Rosario Dawson is beautiful. David Krumholtz is the most entertaining of the bunch. Dennis Farina provides great comic relief. Stanley Tucci delivers one of his best performances. And being that I'm an aspiring independent filmmaker, this movie really inspires me. I watch a lot of mainstream films, watch a certain scene or shot and say, ""That's really cool!"" Yet I think to myself, that's impossible to do on a low-budget. This movie was made on a very low budget and it's absolutely terrific! It's not one of these pretentious, ""Blair Witch""-type projects where we're watching a big old mess, but we're supposed to give it acclaim because it costed below a million bucks. The only thing I have to criticize is the overuse of the jump-cuts. I have nothing against the jump-cut, but the jump-cuts in this film get a bit jarring at times. Much Kudos to Edward Burns for writing and directing this wonderful, inspiring little film. <br /><br />My score: 9 (out of 10)",unsup

The great thing about Chan, is that a) All his own stunts, and b) no wire fighting. Yep, this is the real stuff.<br /><br />This movie was filmed when practical CG was still a little sketchy.

Sure, it was a little talky at times, some characters were just plain unlikable and you truly had to suspend disbelief to follow the film's faux-documentary interviews, which aims to move the story along. But the tangled web of the characters' lives was pretty compelling, especially against the backdrop of New York City. Certainly, it's no Annie Hall or Manhattan--two pictures that this film seems to aspire to--but it's still worth seeing, especially if you like movies with an improvisational feel.",unsup

The acting is real, the directing first rate. Ed Burns reminds me of a young Woodie Allen without the neurosis (which I am glad to be rid of). I really didnt want the film to end. On that note I would have made a few editorial choices a bit differently but otherwise, Dennis Farina,Ed Burns, Turturro, and the fabulous women (*especially that beautiful actress whose name escapes me who played Maria). I found myself laughing way too loudly and then the rest of the audience seemed to realize this was funny. It is I suspect a very New York movie with a unique New York humor but it was a little gem.

Brothers McMullen had similar talk about defecating in front of other guys.) The movie is murkily photographed with a jittery hand-held camera that succeeds in making New York look as jejune as its unbelievable characters. Most annoying was a long closeup of Mr.<br /><br />Burns hairy armpit. That shot seemed to go on forever! I guess if you are the star, writer and director no one is gonna tell you where to put the camera and more importantly- no one is gonna tell you that your characters bear little resemblance to flesh and blood New Yorkers. Disappointing.",unsup
10963_0,"Usually one or two light but clever independent comedies are released during the year. Sidewalks of New York is one of those. These are the films that provide alternatives to the often overproduced Hollywood films. I love these films even when they are imperfect. <br /><br />From the beginning of the film I got the feeling I was watching a Woody Allen film. That feeling faded as the deepness and the dialogue are much inferior to Allen's ingenious work, but Burns can be congratulated on having made a Woody-light film. Even those are rare to come by. The dialogue is still good and witty. This is a smart relationship film and it entertains all the way.<br /><br />There are many interesting characters in Sidewalks, but the standout scene-stealer is Dennis Farina. Extreme sexists are always funny, and Farina fits the role perfectly. My biggest concern with the casting is that Ed Burns directs himself as the lead character, and in retrospect I realize that he is the only male character in the film who isn't ridiculed. Questionable.<br /><br />A couple of sidenotes. Sidewalks was postponed after September 11th. I have no idea why people wouldn't want to see this film because of what happened. Also, notice that the trailer for the film contains a scene where Heather Graham asks Burns if he wants to go out to dinner. This scene is absolutely not in the film, and the film takes another twist. Strange how movie trailers are getting more and more manipulative.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10",unsup

10965_0,"Movies about relationships are nothing new, but this is one of few I've seen that gives equal time to both the male and female perspectives. I wonder how much of it was scripted and how much of it was ad-libbed, because there was a very natural feel to the way the characters expressed themselves. They seemed like real people. Heather Graham should do more films like this--talky, ad-libbed, grown-up relationship movies, which is what she excels at (Two Girls And A Guy). She doesn't need to play dumb blondes and prostitutes all the time. Brittany Murphy plays another quirky character, but like always, she shows that she can play quirky in a variety of ways (Clueless, Don't Say A Word, Girl Interrupted). The unfolding romance with the at-first unlikable David Krumholtz is surprisingly touching. However, I think less time should have been spent on Stanley Tucci's love triangle and more on the Heather Graham-Edward Burns relationship, and more Rosario Dawson. I wish everybody would stop complaining about how they can't find a decent guy or girl out there, when they really need to examine themselves first to see if they are even ""decent"" and ready for a real relationship.",unsup

So this was a new venture for me.<br /><br />It's safe to say, I was very surprised by this film. It has a style and form similar to that of Allen's Husbands and Wives.

Tucci, Murphy and Krumholtz are all on top form too.<br /><br />It's an entertaining piece of cinema, one that didn't take itself too seriously and indulge in those oft-walked streets of New York.

10972_0,"The situations are conspicuously overdone to drive the underlying story, but the side walk interviews do succeed in neutralizing this potentially myopic trap. Writer/Director Burns illustrates the concept of friendship separated form love which is separated from sex.<br /><br />He shows how everything is incomplete and even hollow if those three critical elements of a relationship are way out of balance. A sufficient background is developed for the characters to understand their motivations and what led their lives to this point, but there is a reliance on the audience's own knowledge to complete the concept which may make this movie suit the 25 and over crowd.<br /><br />The web of deceit is spun into a fable where the guilty learn their lessons as they cause the innocent fall from grace. The movie is nearly two hours long, and does feel a little slow, but Burns put in what needs to be there to make his view of neo-post-love sexual relations work.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci had the busiest role as the two timing dentist with his affair on the side. Even his affair is knocked aside when it is inconvenient. Heather Graham finally gets to display her ability to act.

I'm not a big fan of this technique but it does work okay here. Brittany Murphy is very good and shows a lot of natural charm and Rosario Dawson has an interesting role. The only part that doesn't quite ring true is Stanley Tucci as the cheating husband. Why would anyone cheat on Heather Graham?

10975_0,"Tommy (Edward Burns) is a television production man in Manhattan. His girlfriend has just given him the heave-ho from their joint apartment, stating she doesn't want kids and sees no future for them. Tommy is miffed because he gave up his own digs to move in with her, at her request. He temporarily bunks with his boss (Dennis Farina). The boss man is womanizer, boasting that he's slept with 500 women and left most of them ""baying at the moon"". Nevertheless, Tommy wants his own place so he gets in touch with NY realtor, Annie (Heather Graham). They begin at search for a suitable habitat, becoming friends in the process. Annie is married to a dentist named Griffin (Stanley Tucci). Annie wants children but, unknown to her, Griffin is having a fling with a 19 year old transplant from Iowa (Brittany Murphy) and he has been neglecting Annie in a big way. The young lady, Ashley, detests meeting Griffin in hotel rooms but has fallen for Griffin's lying promises. There is an attractive young doorman interested in her, too. Meanwhile, the doorman's beautiful ex-wife, Maria (Rosario Dawson) has met Tommy at the video store. Although she has dated no one since her stinging divorce, she begins a brief affair with Tommy. How will things shake down on the sidewalks of Manhattan? This is a great film and a tour de force for Burns, who wrote and directed it. Certainly, he is one gifted movie maker, as evidenced by his earlier films, including The Brothers McMullen and She's the One. In Sidewalks, he again probes relationships in the modern era, when sex can be around every corner and the more traditional marriage of an earlier age is absent. In doing so, Burns shows his brilliance for a balanced dissection, for he presents differing viewpoints in the course of the flick. All of the players here, from the scumbags Tucci and Farina, to the lovely Dawson to the very attractive Graham, Murphy, and Burns himself, are simply great. Add on a nice NYC setting, some terrific costumes and some great production values and you have a fine looking film as well. The story and direction are faultless, as Burns uses many interesting techniques to tell his tale, including testimonies and flashbacks. Watch out for a bit of rough language and sexual conversation, if that is important to you. However, there are truly no cracks in this Sidewalk, it is one wonderful film. Get your hands on a copy soon, very soon. And, here's hoping Burns will continue to make many more films.",unsup
10976_0,"In a year that has brought much terror to this great city, it is good to see a film that celebrates love and single life in New York- `Sidewalks of New York'. This one is writer-director Edward Burns' new movie. Steady Eddie has done it again! `Sidewalks of New York' is one of the best films of the year! You should `park' yourself to your nearest `central' located theatre, and go see this gem! The film is centered around six characters who are in an 'empire state' of romantic delusion in New York. At various times, an unseen interviewer asks them questions about their romantic lives. This is very effective because it bring us closer to the characters and helps set the scenes with a more direct approach. `Sidewalks of New York' stars Heather Graham, David Krumholtz, Brittany Murphy, Stanley Tucci, Rosario Dawson, Dennis Farina, and Burns. I hope I am not being too `broad' and going out of my `way' when I say that their performances is the best ensemble acting I have seen in a film this year. The acting `queen' here though is Heather Graham. Her work as the romantic free-spirited wife reminded me much of the `Annie Hall' character from Woody Allen's great film of the same name. Also, I think the `stocks are rising' on the chances of Stanley Tucci getting a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. His performance as the cheating husband who is always in a `sexual new york state of mind' is one of the best of the year. However, the best part of the film is Burns' realistic-witty screenplay. It is about time that academy voters realize that Eddie Burns is one of the most talented screenwriters around. I guarantee you will love this New York film. So be a part of it and go see- `Sidewalks of New York' `Sidewalks of New York'. ***** Excellent",unsup

We know a lot of the people that inhabit this movie since, at one time, or another, we have known people just like these.

All the interviews pale in comparison with the one where the director, is photographed with the World Trade Center as a background in all its majesty and glory. Stanley Tucci keeps getting better all the time, being the actor, as he is seen here, or the director in his own film. His interpretation of the creepy dentist whose own masculinity is put into question by the same person he is trying to use and won't let go. Heather Graham plays against type and the result is excellent. Rosario Dawson was a revelation. Her character makes a painful and necessary decision, although, perhaps, we are not prepared for it, when she breaks away from a situation that will only bring her unhappiness, in the long run. Brittany Murphy keeps getting better all the time. She's a natural with a winning smile. The only trouble was that Dennis Farina's character doesn't have a bigger role to play.",unsup
10978_0,"Similar, yet different, from his other films (""The Brother's McMullen"" and `She's the One'), writer/director/producer/actor Edward Burns, with his typical minuscule budget, broaches on Woody Allen territory this time as he explores the ooohs, aaahs and owwwws (mostly the owwwws) of the marriage and dating game. The sights and sounds of New York is in the air as the movie zeroes in on six disparate Manhattanites, all of whom trying their damnest to find the no-real answer to happiness. No belly-laughs here, but a lot of knowing smiles.<br /><br />This brash, perceptive, ultimately winning cyclical comedy first introduces us to good-looking, nice-guy Tommy (Ed Burns) who has just split up with his girlfriend and has been thrown out of her apartment. Tommy takes a sudden interest in evasive school teacher Maria (Rosario Dawson), whom he meets in a video store. Maria is divorced from small, tough-talking schlmiel Ben (David Krumholtz), a doorman and rock musician wannabe who cheated on her. Ben, still pining for Maria, finds a welcome distraction in edgy student/waitress Ashley (Brittany Murphy), who is having an affair with a much older and married dentist, Griffin (Stanley Tucci), whose suspecting wife Annie (Heather Graham), a real estate agent, has her eye on one of her customers, Tommy (back to Ed Burns again), who is (remember?) looking for a new pad since his girlfriend kicked him out. So much for the Kevin Bacon six degrees of separations and divorces angle.<br /><br />To punch up the thought processes of our six relationship-minded specimens, Burns has given his film a documentary/reality TV feel. Each of our protagonists express their own individual and personal philosophies on the meaning of love and sex with a `man on the street' interviewer. These telling bits are conveniently spliced here and there into each of their ongoing stories, which are not only a biting commentary on the social scene, but often humorously contradict their actions and intent.<br /><br />Burns, a native New Yorker, gives us a passionate, authentic, down-to-earth vision of his 'hood. No picaresque postcard images are to be found here. No tourist-like views of Rockefeller Center, the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, etc. And just as dressed-down and down-to-earth is his solid ensemble cast. The stories are evenly laid out with no one performance getting short shrift. Burns, Dawson, Tucci, Murphy, Klumholtz, and Graham all have meaty roles here and each of their stories are well-presented and attention-grabbing. The philandering Tucci character, the least sympathetic of the bunch, still manages to drum up some pity, if not sympathy, for his subsequent actions. What's more, the outside circle, the peripheral friends/instigators/colleagues, etc., add immeasurably to the humor and atmosphere of the piece, particularly Aida Turturro as a worldly wise teacher/friend of Dawson's, Dennis Farina as Burns' overt male chauvinist boss, Michael Leydon Campbell in dual roles as a rocker and male half of a bickering married couple, and Callie Thorne as the bickering wife.<br /><br />No one treats New York better than Woody Allen. With ""Sidewalks of New York"" Edward Burns pays tribute to this fair city, and he pays homage to Mr. Allen -- 1992's ""Husbands and Wives"" in particular. Notice Burns' analytical approach to his characters, the hand-held camera work and jump-cut style of editing (which is actually smoother and less jolting than in Allen's above-mentioned film), the pneumatic jazz score, the reflexive, conversational-like bantering between his characters, the episodic storylines, and, most importantly, the obvious devotion he has for NY. It all but spells out W-O-O-D-Y. But, in this case, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. He's learned well from the master.<br /><br />",unsup

Originally released as ""Shuang Long Hui"" in Hong Kong in 1992, ""Twin Dragons"" cost about $1.3 million, but this chopsocky slapstick earned megabucks at the Asian box office. Along with acclaimed action co-directors Ringo Lam of ""Maximum Risk"" and Tsui Hark of ""Double Team"" and ""Knock Off"" at the helm, Chan starred in the movie to raise funds for the fledging Hong Kong Directors Guild. Although seven years has elapsed since ""Shuang Long Hui"" opened, with VHS copies of it available under a number of titles, Dimension Films not only dusted off ""Twin Dragons"" but also has plastered it on screens across America.<br /><br />Look-a-like brothers has been a favorite theme for novelists and filmmakers long before ""Twin Dragons"" appeared. Mark Twain relied on same siblings as a staple plot device in his celebrated fiction. Like the 1991 Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller ""Double Impact,"" ""Twin Dragons"" casts Jackie Chan as heroic twins rather than as dramatic adversaries. Anybody remember Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Man in the Iron Mask?"" ""Twin Dragons"" starts with a grim but vigorous black & white shoot-out at a hospital. A wounded but dangerous felon escapes from a police escort. Handcuffed to a cart, the villain swipes a detective's gun, shoots him as him, blows off the handcuffs and seizes one of the twin brothers. Wielding the baby as a shield, the henchman shoots another cop and steals an ambulance. An intrepid cop grabs the bumper and is dragged along the street until he puts a bullet in a rear tire. As the vehicle lurches to a halt, the child is hurled into a public grove. A drunken prostitute finds the child and raises him as her own son. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the grief-stricken parents migrate to New York City with their surviving son. Spared nothing by his indulgent parents, John Ma (Jackie Chan of ""Rush hour"") grows up to be a world famous concert pianist/conductor. By comparison, scraping by on bits and pieces, the other twinBoomerdevelops incredible skills as a street fighter when he isn't fixing cars. John Ma leaves the Big Apple to make his Hong Kong debut when the Asian gangsters mistake him for Boomer. Boomer and hi troublesome buddy Tyson (Teddy Robin Kwan) owe the mob a hefty $300-thousand in HK funds, and they are out to collect when Ma shows up.<br /><br />Scenarists Barry Wong, Tsui Hark, Cheung Tung Jo and Wong Yik have added a fillip a la Cheech & Chong's ""The Corsican Brothers"" to the twin brother hysterics by endowing them with a telekinetic link. When John plays piano, Boomer watches while his fingers wriggle to a mysterious rhythm. Only near the end of the action do the filmmakers exploit this psychic power for its full potential. Separated from John by a fenced-in cage, Boomer acts out the kung-fu fight moves, and John inadvertently delivers those stunning blows to flatten his foes. Meanwhile, the scenarists have more fun with the familiar mistaken identities gag that dominates the first two-thirds of the film. Fate and destiny play an immutable part in the proceedings.<br /><br />In the tradition of Shakespeare's ""Comedy of Errors,"" Boomer and John Ma confuse themselves as well as their girlfriends. Inevitably, they wind up with the wrong girls, and the comic predicaments that emerge are entertaining. The fights and the chases are fast-paced and hilariously staged, but then look at the helmersLam and Hark. The fight scene in the Mitsubishi testing facility is a triumphant of comedy and choreography. If you can ignore the inferior dubbing and the obvious special effects, ""Twin Dragons"" is a rewarding riot of hilarity. Hardcore Jackie Chan fans should be able to spot how Chan has modified many of the stunts over the years and used them for full effect in his ""Rush Hour"" movies.",unsup

10983_0,"Sydney reprises his Mr. Tibbs moniker in a nicely paced crime drama that has some well orchestrated action sequences, especially the one at the onset of the film. Those first 10 minutes or so reminded me of the heist scene in ""Rififi"" (1955), in that this scene too was captured with no dialog, letting the viewer see for himself how the action plan was set into motion.<br /><br />Some reviewers ""dissed"" the 70's sound track and street jargon, but what do you expect? It's a period piece, a 70's action film and by definition will employ those contemporary motifs. To me, it's both refreshing and amusing to be thrust back into the cultural modes of yesteryear.<br /><br />The plot line may have had some small weaknesses to it and some of the actors were no Academy Award nominee hopefuls, but the thrust of the film keeps you attentive and anticipatory. Also, it was nice to see Raul Julia, Demond Wilson and Ron O'Neal in one of their earlier films. Sydney, as usual, shines in his rendition of the Tibbs detective. But the plot twists toward the end where Mr. Tibbs puts the pieces together and gets ready to see justice served... Well, see for yourself in this brutally realistic conclusion.",unsup
10984_0,"Perhaps the least-known Poitier work, certainly of the period; at date of writing only nine IMDb members had voted on this film. This is just over 1% of the votes attained by it's initial prequel, the superb ""In The Heat of the Night"". Between the two is the awful-yet-lovable ""They Call Me MISTER Tibbs!"" which took the Virgil Tibbs franchise on a downward slope.<br /><br />Those that do get to see this movie on it's rare t.v. rescreenings and decide to give it a go after the disappointing ""Tibbs"" will be justly rewarded. Essentially, the production team is the same as the previous film, though Gil Melle provides a jazz-orientated score instead of Quincy Jone's adequate but inappropriate themes. The domesticity is also played down, with Alan R.Trustman absent as co-writer and James R. Webb taking full control of the screenplay. Most importantly, though, is Don Medford as the well above average director. Apart from a rather crude edit where a car accident occurs in the second half of the picture, the scenes are melded together seamlessly and flow together exceptionally well.<br /><br />Poitier reprises the role of Tibbs, an arrogant, aloof, bad-tempered, authoritarian, bigoted Lieutenant. As a result, this is probably the most appealing of all Sidney's characters, and he slips back into the role effortlessly. With no star names to support him, such as Rod Steiger or Martin Landau (though Raul Julia did become a star later in life), Sidney stands way above his peers. His ability to project a bad atmosphere every time he walks into a room is flawless. This time he is not let down by the plot, either, which sees Tibbs caught between the Police Department and a vigilante gang that seeks to expose a wide net of heroin dealers. The plot takes on many shifts in loyalty and focus, keeping the attention, while a chase through underground tunnels lends the requisite chase an extra air of tension. The racial motif is again absent, though a rival black cop played by Bernie Hamilton gives off a frisson of resentment.<br /><br />While predictably not of the calibre of ""In Heat of the Night"", The Organization stands as the greatest of Sidney's seventies vehicles.",unsup

The incomparable Albert Finney leading a strong supporting cast, tight direction and a fascinating story.

10988_0,"it seems like all the reviews i've skimmed through have highly praised this flick. although i appreciated a lot about it including great performances by silverstone (ah, those brits ...) and charlotte brittain (who as linda has the most hilarious and poignant mini-soliloquy from the point of view of a ""fat girl"" i have ever heard) and most of its realism including a great ending, i thought there were several elements which were rather contrived, including a ""coming out to the entire school"" scene which veered dangerously towards cheesiness. the thing i found the hardest to believe was that there was a mutual attraction between the two boys. for one, i felt gorton as dixon, the deeply closeted love interest, was rather old for the part and that the movie didn't spend enough time developing their relationship on screen. that is, we have little to no idea of what they do when they're not horsing about, making out, or talking about how much of a strain their relationship is to the both of them. carter clearly isn't much interested in sports and dixon doesn't seem to be much interested in journalism. although it was an enjoyable movie, i don't rank it among the classics such as -beautiful thing- or john greyson's -lilies-, although they too had similar failings with regard to underdeveloping the nature of the relationship of the protagonists.",unsup
10989_0,"Still wondering if we need to compare this film with ""Beautiful Thing"".I guess because they're both british and coming of age? Actually Beautiful Thing had some cheesy acting and some dull moments; hey guys remember ""Wild Reeds"" hu?, that was a coming of age movie too, close to the same plot line as Get Real. Get Real was well directed, very good acting and script adaptation from a play. With some twisted moments and I'm sure that people, especially gay dudes, will find themselves relating and empathizing with the main character; a totally big + in a movie. But, Get Real had a few faults as well. Some of the scores were too contrived, the scene when they were slow dancing and ""You are so beautiful to me"" song plays; Aretha Franklin singing the words freedom after the coming out scenario, etc. I'm putting myself in the jock's place, and no way this dude will go for a 100 pound, pale, goofy gay guy; another thing is would you cruise a public bathroom for a quickie leaving your private school uniform on? If you want to be so discreet about your sexual preferences, hey get your butt across town, or if you are so in love with the good looking jock, man, you would do anything to keep the relationship. Some of the scenes contradict themselves in such obvious ways that through the flick you find yourself asking, what is going on? However, Get Real with all it's faults, saves itself because it gives you good insight of how others feel being alianated, estranged and how to deal with society for being themselves. A good moral in the end; an all around feel good scene; reminds me of ""SLC PUNK"", which I found myself totally relating to.",unsup
1098_0,"This is an excellent Jackie Chan film that gets too little credit and too much criticism. This movie is just plain FUN--Chan as twin brothers separated at birth who reunite many years later in Hong Kong, just in time to get crossed up in a nasty mess with vicious gangsters...how can you not love this? In addition to using the wonderful plot premise of twins (and two Jackie Chans is definitely better than one), there's some great action choreography in this movie, including some nice big explosions, and what has to be one of the best uses ever conceived of for a Mitsubishi factory.<br /><br />The ""psychic link"" between the twin Chans is used to great effect as well, in everything from the hilarious conducting scene, to the subtly painful groin shot during the auto factory fight.<br /><br />And the ending?

But it still works wonderfully on its own terms.<br /><br />The movie is well-acted by the whole cast and the story is realistic (unfortunately) and true to life. Some people have complained that the interactions between the two boys keep running hot and cold way too often. Well welcome to real life! I know of similar situations with friends and this movie captured them perfectly. Also the isolation and longing of the gay boy was so accurate. There's a sequence at a dance when the two boys are staring longingly at each other while dancing with two women they couldn't care less about. That scene brought tears to my eyes! Also when the gay teen tells off the guy he's in love with and the closing scene (don't want to give it away) were also extremely powerful and honest. The film also ends realistically BUT not depressingly. Also, the film IS funny. It's not a comedy, but it does have its light moments. See it! It's well worth 8 or 9 bucks.<br /><br />",unsup

While entertaining at times and with some truly funny situations, it falls short in many respects. The acting seems to suffer as the hunk just isn't believable in some key scenes. And can anyone make a movie without using most or all of the stereotypes? The character who's comfortable being gay is not athletic and gets beat up. The character who doesn't want to be gay is athletic and snubs his gay lover. The girl next door is overweight, wears too much makeup and is dramatic, so of course she is the gay guy's best friend. C'mon, can't we be a little more realistic. I'm giving this movie high marks for being what it is, but it could have been so much more. I think I'll watch ""Beautiful Thing"" again.",unsup

10995_0,"This film touching the rather trivial (it's the year 2004) theme of coming out, achieves through a fine tune of its elements: plot, dialogs, characters, messages, events storied etc. to offer an exceptional and unique view of it.<br /><br /> From the beginning it is not to compare with ""Beautiful Thing"" because it addresses somewhat older characters and its humor and dialogs are less general and more mature. It serves a rather specific goal and end which lacks from the rather simple realistic story-telling of ""Edge of Seventeen"". It does not transmit as much as exaggeration and irony which would put it aside the reality like ""But I'm a Cheerleader"". <br /><br />However, it reserves some purity by not getting into the charming British gay bourgeoisie like ""Like it is"". It does not suffer of french lyricism like ""Presque Rien"". The fluctuation of the feelings and events is more breezy than in ""It's in the water"". Finally, the plot is more self-composed than in ""A cause d'un Garcon"" and it is not meant to be seen by clueless straight public like ""In and Out"".<br /><br />As shortcomings may be considered the lack of ""happily ever after..."" ending, the somewhat too aggressive, for the spectator, plot development, the discreet appearance of several trivia and the lack of ""mouth wide open"" laughing humor.",unsup

10999_0,"Having read much of the criticism and praise of others commenting on ""Get Real"", there really isn't much that I can say that hasn't been said elsewhere.<br /><br />I would like to comment on the criticism that the dialogue was poor. Teens never talk in most films like they do amongst one another. Here, to a good degree, they do. The actors weave brilliantly between the awkward clumsiness and bold cockiness that most teens display. It isn't tiresome at all, it's refreshing and interesting. There is also a great amount of communication that isn't purely driven by dialogue and it's exceptional between the two main players. <br /><br />If you'd like to see a super film, with flawless acting all around, this is a delightful portrayal of two boys at very different places where self-acceptance is concerned. It certainly raises the bar on gay genre films to something that should be enjoyable to the general public.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the music is rather standard fare.",unsup
1099_0,"Please note--this review is for the English-dubbed version. It's about 11 minutes shorter than the original film and I have no way of knowing how close it stuck to the original vision. It seemed to be dubbed reasonably well, but having never seen the original Chinese version, I am only guessing.<br /><br />The idea of making a Corsican Brothers-like film with two Jackie Chans sounded pretty dumb when I read about this movie. And, while in parts it is awfully silly, the overall effort was far better than I expected and was one of the better Chan movies I have seen.<br /><br />The movie begins with a prologue which shows how two twins were accidentally separated just after birth. The parents cannot locate the lost child and are forced to raise the remaining child. The second is fund by what appears to be a prostitute and this child is raised in a poor household. Many years later, when the rich and privileged Jackie returns to Hong Kong, he accidentally is mixed up for the poor one--the one that the local mob wants to kill! Now had this just been an action film with fight scene after fight scene, I think it wouldn't have worked as well. But, given that Jackie Chan did the movie a huge amount of comedy and clever situations involving two separate girlfriends were infused into the plot. Several times, I found myself laughing at some of the silliness of it all, but I also was impressed by how well the film all worked together pretty seamlessly.<br /><br />There were only two complaints about the film. First, the poor Jackie snorted a lot. Why? Couldn't there have been a better way to distinguish between them than making one of them sound like he's a pig or has a really bad cold? Secondly, the film seemed to go on a bit too long--particularly at the action-packed conclusion. Knocking five or ten minutes off would have probably made the film a bit better--as the fight scene just went on and on and on. Still, this is a decent martial arts film and is worth a look and a laugh.<br /><br />FYI--The film's second billing went to Maggie Cheung--a relatively famous Asian actress who has made a variety of excellent films. However, her role was no bigger or more prominent than the other lady in the film who didn't appear until much further in the credits. Bummer.",unsup
109_0,"Four stars? - give me a break!<br /><br />I was thrilled and amused when I saw this as a kid - so many unconventional scenes, so many people who don't behave ...<br /><br />Alright this is not that entertaining for people of today who have lost any attention span. And it's not as brilliantly made as ""Where's Poppa?"", also written by Robert Klane, but it does have its moments, i.e. most scenes that Arkin and Gardenia are in. Reiner is pretty inept here as usual, though. Kay Medford is very good as a Mother out of touch with reality. A good cast in general.<br /><br />Some scenes lack a better execution but on the whole this is an original idea that has several subplots which are nicely tied up. Greed, ineptness, dysfunctional families, madness and irritation manifest themselves in many different ways. <br /><br />Most locations are pretty ""awful"" by today's viewing habits but that is the exact charm of this movie as opposed to all the slick and sterile over-produced forgettable comedies of today. The settings make this movie look ""real"" and might tend to make people uneasy about the story because it seems people don't really get their way - no matter how they try. That makes for good comedy because this is how life is when you constantly overreach: You make a fool of yourself.<br /><br />The main problem with this seems to be that the ideas are funny but better production and direction would not have hurt. This could very well be remade but I doubt people today want to see anyone on the screen who is over 40 years old... And that is pathetic.",unsup
10_0,"Finally, I got to see this legendary masterpiece on TV. When I first heard that there was an Arabian movie featuring the Western icon ""Hopalong Cassidy""(William Boyd) and the Gothic icon Boris Karloff, the idea sounded like a disparate joke. (Actually, Karloff only plays a brief, minor role, being new to the silver screen at that time.) <br /><br />The script is very original. The shooting is excellent for the times. And the acting is so well done, you feel what the characters feel, and can easily read the actors' lips for practically every line. Unlike many silent-era films, you get the sensation that you are in this one.<br /><br />The comedy starts right from the opening scene, and I will describe it only to illustrate the unexpected silliness of William Boyd: He is in a night battle in World War I, and drops into a shell crater to avoid German gunfire. His 1st Sergeant, a bully and a brute whom he despises, had just fallen in before him, and is unconscious. Boyd tries to revive him until he sees who he is, and starts slinging mud on the Sergeant's face. He revives and they immediately jump into a fistfight in the mud. When a flare illuminates the night sky, they look up and see the hole is surrounded with numerous Germans with bayonets. The enemy was having a time watching them fight each other! It is an eye opener to see the future Hopalong Cassidy in a real cut-up comedy role, back when he looked like a very young cross between Marlon Brando and Jack Haley.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the nitty-gritty reality in this film about POW's of World War I, in an era when glossed-over heroics and reality-denial dominated war films. Moreover, there is often a timeless feeling, especially during the POW camp scenes, which gives the viewer a sense of closeness to the people of that era; and the understanding that people have at all times in history been, in their own way, ""modern.""<br /><br />The dual-based plot, (survival and escape, and later a pursuit of romance), rolls steadily through ever-changing backgrounds. The factors of comedy, action, danger, and romance blend harmoniously throughout. The relationship between Boyd's and Wolheim's characters develop from utter hatred, to enduring animosity, to forced survival cooperation, to mild mutual suspiciousness, to amorous competition, to strong friendship.<br /><br />Though this is a silent film from 1927, centered on World War I in Europe and Turkey, I have never had such a modern and timeless feeling from a silent movie. This results from the cool, timeless acting and characterizations, and the excellent directing and shooting.<br /><br />This is the first silent drammatic film my kids have thoroughly enjoyed, (until now only preferring silent comedic standards by Keaton, Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd.)",unsup

11002_0,"One of the better gay-themed dramas from recent years, GET REAL follows a well-established formula (identified in some of the other posts here), and thus is a bit short on originality, but does feature some fine performances, and - in subtle ways - does manage to touch upon other issues which help to cut through the rose-colored romance that frames much of the story.<br /><br />**MINOR SPOILERS** <br /><br />I was glad to see a self-aware young gay character - there still aren't enough, and found the conflicted boyfriend (John) to be quite an interesting character as well - bringing to life (in many scenes) the connections between homophobia, violence, social pressure and generalized lack of self-awareness. The rather complex ending had its' good and bad points - the coming-out speech could've been sharper (this would've perhaps heightened the emotional tension of the scene), but I found the ending to be otherwise quite satisfactory - Steven, as a self-aware young gay man, possesses a strength and self-assurance that places him far ahead of John, whose cowardly retreats into violence betray a confusion that will only create problems in other people's lives until he gains the strength to work things out for himself. No strong, self-aware human being should ever need to put up with getting literally kicked around, which Steven is smart enough to already know, which his why he can ride off into the sunset loveless but confident - such a liberated ending (while no 'happily-ever-after' romance) more than validates the occasional 'after-school-special' moments that preceded it.<br /><br />There are many moments here that could form the basis for any number of provocative follow-ups: the contradictions of John, or the relationships - supportive or otherwise - with parents (grossly under-explored in gay drama) or teachers. Overall GET REAL isn't flawless, but it's many perceptive moments of both sweetness and intelligence very much make it worth seeing.",unsup
11003_0,"I rented this movie by chance without expecting much. But after watching it, I am inspired to write my first review ever! <br /><br />The movie revolves around Steve's journey from knowing that he is gay to coming out in the open. This is conveyed beautifully through his on-off relationship with the school jock, Johnny. The importance of family and friend's support in such situations is also highlighted.<br /><br />The acting is first class. Especially, the tension between Steve and Johnny when they bump into each other in a public toilet is so real.<br /><br />But what sets this movie apart from similar movies is its unique take on the subject. Movies like ""Beautiful Thing"" portray that society is prejudiced against all gays. But this movie shows that the society treats ""elite"" people differently proving that it is just another form of discrimination. Despite Johnny's friends knowing about his gay relationship with Steve, they conveniently ignore the fact and instead blame Steve for it. In the end, this only results in Steve becoming free and Johnny remaining closeted.<br /><br />Must watch for all!!",unsup

The screenplay is so interesting, a lot more than Beautiful Thing's, we can feel Johnny and Steve's emotion, the fear of being ""discovered"" because of the reactions of all those stupid people...

Of course, the British ""humour"" only adds to the overall flavor of this particular flick. Linda and her comments and driving lessons give the work a uplifting life goes on kind of feel. All of the characters were very well developed and actors carefully selected. As far as the ""coming of age"" and ""coming to terms with one's sexuality"" films are concerned, this one really captures a realistic view.

I cannot say that this is the greatest piece of cinema ever created, from dialog to production values, many parts of the movie are askew (not to mention the often indecipherable British mumbling!), but it has given me hope that as a gay teenager I will someday find the type of love I am looking for.",unsup
11009_0,"I first saw ""Get Real"" in mid-May 2006. Looking back at this film and when it was released (1999 in the USA) it is startling that the sexual repression that is so prevalent in the film, can still exist in this day and age. The film ""Maurice"" (1987) took place in 1910 and the repression was worse and yet that film had a much more positive ending.<br /><br />In 'Get Real' the two characters, Steven Carter and John Dixon couldn't be more different in their sexual experiences. It's Steven Carter the younger boy who has had more sexual contact with men and its John Dixon who is unable to deal with his sexual feelings. <br /><br />I find that the character, John Dixon, is the most fascinating of the two boys because he is living a double life. He presents an image of strong, athletic and smart, but he is also filled with anxiety, confusion and doubts.<br /><br />Like the most of us. John Dixon's greatest fear is that people will find out about his true sexual identity. In the end John Dixon is in severe denial, he is blind to the reality of his sexuality and but it cannot be denied. Is this love these two boys are experiencing? This is a newly discovered sexual companionship, and a very deep emotional connection that neither one has ever experienced before.<br /><br />It is all new and exciting. This intensity clouds what is really happening to them.The only way they can express honesty to each other is for the boys to reach for some booze, that is the only way some very painful truths will surface. There are two very powerful and revealing scenes that are key to the whole film and that are emotionally raw and memorable. <br /><br />Yet they make promises they never can keep. John Dixon was so afraid of any one finding out he was gay, that he piled on needless lies, to his parents and friends and then he began to resent Steven and despise himself.<br /><br />These two boy's were very dependent on one another and the result was they became very needy, which then had the effect of suffocating one another. They needed to come up for some air.<br /><br />Sadly, John Dixon doesn't realize that a lot of Steven's friends and family know about him. John's friend's suspect the truth and so does his father. He could of said something to them, but that is easier said than done.<br /><br />John Dixon is so consumed by fear he can't see 'straight'. John strikes back at Steven Carter in a most vicious way. John Dixon tells Steven Carter that he loves him but his actions reveal the real truth. <br /><br />It's not how you 'feel' towards someone that shows you love them. It is how you treat them, and that is with respect and decency. Is this love or hate?",unsup

11010_0,"I loved this movie when I caught it late night on a cable channel and am not sorry I stayed up most of the night watching this saga of two boys in love (or, at least one of them played by Ben Silverstone). Few movies have the power to move you, and this one did me.<br /><br />I felt Steven's pain as he pined for the Brad Gorton character, John, especially after the two hooked up. John was the macho and popular jock, and had to keep up appearances, even if it meant humiliating Steven publicly with his friends.<br /><br />The scene that meant the most to me and that resonated the most with me was the scene in the gym where Steven was dancing with his best girlfriend and John was with his ""girlfriend"". The two barely took their eyes off each other. I, myself, have experienced such a moment. Not quite the same as that where I wasn't dancing with anyone at the time, but the girl I loved and still love was, and we maintained eye contact despite her dancing with someone else. That scene ripped at my heartstrings.<br /><br />I don't know if John was in love with Steven. Possibly. But Steven was in love with John. Steven came out at the end in a most dramatic way at a school assembly when he accepted an award with John looking on, but John never came out at all. John, in my estimation, was bisexual or bi-curious and not a confirmed homosexual like Steven. Maybe I am wrong about that. We don't know. It seems that the two of them did not get back together by the end, and we as the audience were left hanging and left to guess what happened after the dramatic school assembly coming out.<br /><br />The movie is funny, charming, somewhat kitschy, and poignant. I recommend it to any young person, straight or gay, and any ""old"" person who wants to re-live the pangs of youth and unrequited (or requited... if temporarily as here) first love.",unsup
11011_0,"I have just watched this film as part of Film 4's British Connection. I felt this film was an excellent exploration of homosexuality in the heart of Middle Class Britain. I lived close to the film's location Basingstoke when this was made and am the same age (give or take a year) as the main character, Stephen. Whilst never being as confident in my sexuality as Stephen, I really connected with the story told, his relationship with his parents and the scatter-shot but inadvertently appropriate use of homophobic abuse by the bullies.<br /><br />Also thought the excellent flashes of dialogue uplifted the film such as ""Whenever I see that badge (Head Boy) I wish it were an invitation."" Priceless. The performances are almost perfect through out (I was a little unconvinced by Jon the Head Boy to begin with but warmed to him hugely as the film and love story progressed.) The cinematography is suitably understated and this is not the most cinematic film ever shot, which I feel helps with the realism. Some of the symbolism is quite fantastic, especially the closing shot, which I wont spoil.<br /><br />I found it to be a much more recognisable film for me than Brokeback Mountain, Not to that films detriment, it is a masterpiece but I may feel closer to this because I have regularly been to the Odean in Basingstoke, but have never herded sheep on a snowy mountainside with Jake Gyllenhall. <br /><br />It is a simple effective narrative about a subject close to my heart and I recommend it highly.",unsup
11012_0,"If ""Get Real"" chronicles anything, it is that messed-up jumble of a time that gay men have as teenagers, trying to be true to themselves without giving too much offense to those who abhor them. The mixed-up measures they take to express themselves and give expression to their feelings of desire and adolescent lust, suppressed by community morality and repressed by personal fear and self-hatred, unfolds over the London suburb of Basinbroke where a stick figure of a 16-year-old--Steven Carter--sits in or outside a public bathroom, trying to make contact with someone. He finds it unexpectedly with the big man on the high-school campus who garners immeasurable pleasure from their private meetings, but cannot bear the thought of being outed. The story passes through a grist mill of situations that leave the viewer with the simplistic notion that everything will be fine, if you just have the courage to be yourself with others. If it were that easy, I'm sure Brandon Teena would still be alive today.<br /><br />Adapted from Patrick Wilde's play ""What's wrong with being angry,"" ""Get Real"" sends a manifesto to parents and teachers about the supposed pressures they may be putting on their children, gay or otherwise. If you're willing to accept it on this level, the movie functions as an emotional release for all those pent-up gay teenagers who couldn't vent their anger and frustrations at the forces that impose on their burgeoning dreams. But if you try to take it any deeper, then you'd have to consider the internal struggles of John Dixon, the object of Steven's desire, because that is one of the few places in this movie where something is at stake. Johnny (as Steven likes to call him) travels a thornier road, and although Brad Gorton doesn't quite seem up to the challenge, his self-conscious jock does not seem so much a coward in the end as someone saddled with all the trappings of his gentrified upbringing who doesn't want to let go of them. Johnny Boy's smart, but like all teenagers, he's thwarted by desires that defy his good sense.<br /><br />And that is a shame, because if there ever was reason to give up everything for love, Ben Silverstone would be it. He is the real find in this picture. He's the most elegantly constructed scarecrow to touch the silver screen (Seeing him, Conrad Veidt and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" come to mind.), and it's amazing what calm he brings to the center of this movie. Unlike newcomer Gorton, the camera loves Silverstone, and it takes him in as if he were born to be in front of it. If that weren't enough, this young actor (He is about the same age that Steve should be.) has a voice that rivals Jeremy Irons for expressiveness and majesty. Imagine him as Hamlet or Edward II or in a remake of ""Brideshead Revisited"" and that sultry sound pouring forth in velvety plenitude. Why, it's enough to make you stand up and salute the Queen Mother.<br /><br />With Stacy Hart as the iridescent Jessica whose dance with Steve is probably the sexiest scene in the entire movie.<br /><br />",unsup
11013_0,"A move that hits the heart in so many places. Two teenagers, one knowing of his homosexuality, and one refusing it. This is a move that I think everyone should watch. It opens up ones' mind into the complications and implications involved with the entire circle around someone who is gay. Mostly it provides an understanding into the pain and confusion one faces when they are gay. This movie will stick with me forever, and no doubt moved up to my top favorite movie of all time because of its similarity with my life and my own homosexuality. The actors, especially Brad Gorton, aren't that bad either :) He's a terrific actor with an incredible capability for realism.",unsup
11014_0,"Intelligently scripted, well-crafted and exceptionally acted story of a young gay man finding his way through the adolescent wilderness. The situations that arise, when one finds themselves serving too many masters, are portrayed in a moving, heart warming manner. A great balance of relevant humor and teenage emotional tribulation is struck, without so much as a gram of maudlin melodrama, which normally crops up in films of this nature (especially American ones). In the good ol' USA, teenage development in movies tend to be played for laughs or for mawkish sentiment, which could propel whining into an Olympic event.<br /><br />In a short summation, Steve Carter, the main protagonist, finds the path to love strewn with thorns. His friend and counsel, Linda, walks the same road. Steve in discovering himself, discovers that anguish is also a companion to love. <br /><br />GET REAL does just that in such an honest, disarming way, that it exudes originality. The performances and characterizations, are far ranging and finely realized. There's not a weak link in the chain, either in performance, script execution or direction. Innovative and fresh from start to finish. A contemporary classic that is highly recommended.",unsup
11015_0,"Could a more realistic demonstration of what it is like to be young exist than this film? Don't think so. <br /><br />A lot of talk centers around how hard growing up is for teenagers. Yet seldom is it mentioned that however hard it is for straight kids to grow up, it is a million times harder for gay kids, who have no one to turn to for help - not friends, not teachers, not parents, not the church, not books, not counselors, not ANYONE. This film shows what it is like. And it further shows the horrid situation that a young gay athlete finds himself in, torn between being able to do what he enjoys (sports) and being able to be himself. When you're gay, you can't have both, thanks to the homophobia which still rules athletics with an iron fist.<br /><br />The two main characters of this film struggle to maintain a relationship, because they are in love - yet ultimately the homophobic attitudes of the world force them to part. Tragic, yet it is a tale that plays itself out in every little town on the globe. In spite of this, it is a tale never before told on film. It's about time. This should be required viewing for all high school students.",unsup
11016_0,"I'm not biased or anything (being gay myself) but gay themed movies always seem to be better than most of the standard Hollywood fare that's churned out year after year. Gay themed films always seem more uplifting and fun to watch, and always stay with me long after I've watched them. Beautiful Thing, Stonewall, Grief, Priscilla, and now Get Real, one of the best films (gay or not) that I've seen in ages.<br /><br />Get Real is brilliant on so many levels. Firstly, it's a film that's realistic. It paints a picture that doesn't necessarily have a happy ending but still leaves you with a warm feeling inside. It's not apologetic, and shows some of the not always appealing aspects of gay life (cottaging, vicious gay-bashing, etc). But it transports you into it's charming world of first love and that feeling you get once you become infatuated with someone.<br /><br />The cast of Get Real are amazing. Ben Silverstone is a genuine star as Steven, pulling off the right mixture of pride and confusion excellently. Brad Gorton is equally good as John, making you genuinely believe he is a confused soul in a confused world. Charlotte Brittain is fabulous as Linda, and the rest of the cast are all perfect in their roles.<br /><br />Get Real is funny, moving and totally engrossing. A perfect movie for anyone who remembers their first crush, in fact, a perfect movie for any occasion. Quite simply, perfect.",unsup
11017_0,"I rented the movie ""Double Jeopardy"" one evening and was skipping through the previews when I saw the trailer for this movie. I had heard about it before from a few friends who had seen it and had read about it in TIME magazine, not knowing much about the movie. Growing up in a household where being ""different"" in that sense is not acceptable, it has been hard for me to deal with my issues without support from my parents. I went to the local video store a few nights ago and immediately picked out ""Get Real"" to watch and enjoy. What I didn't expect was how true to life this movie really is!<br /><br />""Get Real"" is the story about a 16-year old gay teenager named Steven Carter (played by the boyishly adorable Ben Silverstone) who has known about himself since he was 11-years old and is perfectly fine with it. Although he is dying to be accepted for who he is and not for who he pretends to be, he is afraid to tell his peers and his parents about his true nature. Only his best friend Linda (Charlotte Brittain, who delivers a terrific performance) knows and is worried about Steven, due to his sexual adventures at a gay men's restroom in a park. But one day, he unexpectedly has an encounter with the ""straight"" high school jock John Dixon (Brad Gorton, who plays his role of someone with much sexual confusion with complete realism) and the two boys fall in love. Steven wants to be open about the relationship, while John wants to hide his love for Steve. These differences, along with many others than I will not spoil for those who have not seen this, lead to one of the most tear-jerking endings I have ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />Bravo to everyone involved for creating such a realistic story! Being gay is not easy these days, especially for teenagers, but we all wish we were as brave as Steven, who matures as the movie goes on and we all hope the best for him as he embarks on his emotional recovery after the end of this movie. Way to go Steven!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, see it soon! It is worth your every buck!<br /><br />RATING: 10 out of 10!<br /><br />Rent this m",unsup
11018_0,"I normally wouldn't bother writing a review for a made for TV movie, but I got stuck watching while at home for Christmas. Christmas movies are supposed to be kind of cliched, they have to be because Christmas has become a cliche to most people. This movie took that idea and ran with it.<br /><br />First you have the reluctant Santa Claus, which has only been done a few dozen times in recent years. Then there is the rich man falling in love with the hired help, coupled into man being engaged to one woman only to realize it was a mistake and that he is really in love with girl-come-lately. Then add some cookie-cutter characters, like the proper butler giving sage advice. Or how about that the hired help has a mystery son. I say mystery son because it is never explained if the son is from a bad marriage, out-of marriage, widowed, etc. At least I don't remember it being explained. I won't even go into the goofy cop, the swindling best friend, incredibly sappy happy ending, etc.<br /><br />I think there are people in the world who would relish a movie like this, but if cliches, and telegraphed plot twists turn your stomach, then avoid this movie.",unsup

Who better to play the role of a ""young"" Santa struggling with identity and relationship issues than the actor who played Frasier all of those years. No good story is complete without a good villain, and Elaine Hendrix -- who played the gold-digging fiancée in ""The Parent Trap"" -- again played the part to perfection.<br /><br />I especially liked the subtext of how the power and love of the holiday spirit can overcome the cruel, corrupt world surrounding us.<br /><br />Give it a look...with the family!",unsup

This one plays more like an ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"", so that helped it with me a bit as well. I liked how they opened by recapping the first one and then basically telling you it had nothing to do with this one. There was a part where they had this squirrel investigating something and talking in a chipmunk voice. There were a couple of other good jokes I liked as well, like the guy that could not get a girl yet he looked like the type of guy girls chase after. All in all though most of the jokes were stupid and fell flat and the movie just tried to gross you out for the sake of grossing you out.

11029_0,"Thankfully one of the producers was there at last night's Inside Out screening, so I got a chance to untangle some of the tendrils of this incredibly complicated movie built up around the unbelievable Craig Russell, whose performance and drag impersonations just stand on top of the thing. It is not told from the inside of the queer community. But in the white-guy-ends-apartheid role, they have mind-bogglingly put in a Crazy Woman. (this is firstly a function of Margaret Gibson's source story, which is told from the author's POV) At first you get squirmy and expect that the parallel this character articulates between her and drag queen Russell - ""We're both crazy"" - will be used as an excuse for the good old queer self-loathing, but in fact this is in a different tradition, that King-of-Hearts, madness-as-sentimental-symbol-for-nonconformity thing that was in vogue then. The problem is that Hollis McLaren plays this woman very theatrically - she actually STARES THROUGH HER FINGERS at one point - and in general she probably inspired Catherine O'Hara's turn in ""We're Gonna Be All Right You Creep Leaving Home And All, Eh?"" But even though wr/dir Richard Benner was apparently far more interested in this theme than in the gay scene, and even though Benner seriously does not know how to point a camera, this actually does end up giving a pretty good time capsule of Toronto's 70s gay scene - and not just the hairstyles! We're also presented with a scene that is tiny, remote and claustrophobic, with drag queens at the bottom of a rigid internal hierarchy, everyone's on the skids, and dykes are harpies from another planet. Financed with cash from friends, not Alliance or the CFDC, this movie has to take responsibility for its own neurosis, but it also must be credited with the brilliance of the impersonations, and nb: apparently Russell was Mae West's house boy, and the routines he does are all impersonations of MAE WEST'S impersonations!

Hollis McLaren is the ideal nut case. And Helen Shaver, in one of her earlier roles, is ideal as the friend who is accepting of people for who they are, embellishing their positive traits.<br /><br />My one criticism of the film is the costuming. Not Russell's drag apparel, which matched each of his impersonations perfectly. But other wardrobe choices in the film were distractingly awful, especially during the Christmas party scene.

It has the right amount of fighting without becoming boring and monotonous; it has the right amount of comedy without being over the top.

I found out this film was produced on a shoestring budget and the best thing you can say, if you're lucky enough to view it, is ""you'd never know"". The story may seem familiar, but a few twists and turns gives the spectator a nice little ride through deception. There are many reasons to give this film a look from the fine performances by some rising stars to the photographic angles which brings life to the background. I am not trying to say it's the next best thing to peanut butter and it's time for an Oscar; I am saying it was a fun ride and worth the E-Ticket!",unsup

11049_0,"I've met Linda Howard a few times. I know Linda Howard's writing. And this movie is NO Linda Howard plot. In the true tradition of Harlequin Romances, their movies strip any semblance of passion, pacing and plot.<br /><br />Linda Howard is known throughout the womens' fiction world as being a writer with very tight plots, slick and sassy words, and the hottest, most erotic love scenes.<br /><br />How they managed to strip ALL of this, including the original story, from this movie, I don't know. But it must've taken a monstrous effort.<br /><br />We have Cannon, the hero, who is no Alpha male, by any stretch. He's so New Age, you can smell the Brie on his breath. Which is sad, as Nick Mancuso is a fine actor and capable of so much more. If only it had been written for him! And the heroine... what can one say about the heroine? The eponymous heroine, Evie, has about as much sizzle as an uncooked rasher of bacon. Part of this is due to the lamentable script which never met a cliché' it didn't like. Part is due to the actress, Kelly Rowan, whom I've never seen before. She's petite, meek, and, even when angry, makes you wonder where the fire went. During the climactic scene, where you might think she'd be in fear for her life, she acts as if she's shopping for bread and milk.<br /><br />The story here bears little resemblance to Ms. Howard's story. The main protagonists have been dumbed down to the level of ho-hum. There's no real pacing, in fact, the entire movie feels more like a stroll in the park. Where is the emotion of two people falling in love, yet not trusting each other? Don't look for it here.<br /><br />Oh, why go on? Any tension is in the viewer, wondering when it will all end.<br /><br />The result is a film not worth viewing. Please don't judge Linda Howard's work by this film. It's lamentable that her name be attached. I do hope they paid her a truckload of cash for this travesty.",unsup

The character designs are fun, and even if they're sometimes cliché or annoying, they're bearable overall.<br /><br />The writing style is campy for sure, but the show's a great piece of nostalgia and I'd gladly shell out the money for a good-quality set of the original episodes.",unsup

11051_0,"The first thing I must say is that I have not read the book so I can only go by what I saw on the small screen and at this point a further introduction is necessary. Loving Evangeline appears to be one of twelve Mills and Boon/Shilloute romance novels that have been brought to the small screen. I have seen 10 and these are:- Another Woman, A change of place, The awakening, Broken Lullaby, Hard to forget, The Waiting game, This matter of marriage, Diamond Girl,Recipe for revenge and Loving Evangeline. So to get the best out of these movies or to see the worst you must view them in the context of this being a romance novel brought to the screen. It is a pity if these movies do not follow the course of the original book but still view it as a mills and boon brought to film nonetheless. So how does loving Evangeline rate? Well I liked it! Out of the ten that I have watched I would put it at position 5 and to explain this I will run down what is needed to bring a mills and boon/shilloutte romance to film. First of all the couple must look the part the man must be strong and handsome and the woman beautiful and their must be the chemistry! The background story must not overshadow the romance so to overcome this our couple should be seen together in 70% of the film. The Mills and Boon man must have integrity. For example in Broken Lullaby there was a seen where our heroine was shot at now she was understandably upset and as a result got close to our Mills and Boon man and one thing led to another if you get my drift. The Mills and Boon man should have checked with the lady and made sure it was okay to proceed but in this case he just got down to business. Points lost. Another thing that is essential for a Mills and Boon man is that if he is going to get into a fight he should win. In broken Lullaby and Loving Evangeline both mills and boon men got into fights and lost!! Finally there must be a marriage resolution at the end of the film. Loving Evangeline did not have the marriage resolution and I would not have pegged our hero as a typical Mills and boon man but the film did keep me going because of the competency of the actors and a none too taxing storyline so I did like it!! Now if you are wondering what my top five films are I shall tell you. 5th Loving Evangeline. 4th Recipe for Revenge. 3rd Another woman. 2nd The Awakening and my number one Mills and Boon film is DIAMOND GIRL. I managed to get nine of these films via ebay at extremely good bargain basement prices so you could check out all ten and even get the ones that I have not seen yet and these are Treacherous Beauties and At the Midnight Hour.",unsup
11052_0,"Okay, I admit it, I approached this from the perspective of a Nick Mancuso fan. I'd never read any book at all by Howard, let alone this one, so I have to take the movie at face value. Beautiful scenery, appealing heroine Rowan, nice moments between her and Nick. I took the movie more as a study of how he changes throughout -- he starts out so stiff and rigid (Ultra Businessman) and ends up relaxed and charming, particularly in their dessert scene. Was it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Was he meant to be a dashing hero? Um, no; he got knocked out cold the first time up to bat with the bad guy, and in the end the police did all the hard work. Bad guy (creepy and menacing up to that point) gave up too easily; Shari Belafonte was oddly stiff -- and there were a lot of things left unclear, like how Cannon's brother figured out what was up in the first place. It was lightweight, yes, but it was hardly hate-worthy. I did get pretty tired of Nick pushing up his glasses, but on the other hand, was highly intrigued by the Mars Bar dessert. Hey. Take what you can get. And Nicky, well, he's still got it. So if you've never read the book (I still haven't) and you like Nick... g'wan. Try it. Hardly hurts at all.",unsup

There is no Grant Shaw in the book, Grant Shaw is the actor from Melrose Place. And who is Mrs. Beacham? She is not in the book, either.<br /><br />Anyone who has read this book and may be tempted to watch this piece of cheap filmmaking, don't bother. It is not worth it. Even if it wasn't based on a Howard book, this movie is not worth your time. Paint your nails, hammer some nails, eat some nails, anything other than watching this drivel makes more sense.

I am a big fan of escapist romance, and I can forgive a lot of schmaltz and cheesiness in a low budget film if there is a credible connection between the characters and the plot is even halfway believable. But this movie embarrasses a genre that to begin with does not have much to recommend it in terms of higher artistic value. Don't waste your time watching this movie - especially if you are expecting it to resemble the book in any way whatsoever. But do check out some of Linda Howard's novels. She writes quality romantic escapism without forsaking skillful character development and interesting, suspenseful plots. She is a talented writer.

11059_0,"It doesn't get much sillier than this for the serious sci-fi buff, but as low-expectation, old fashioned ""Saturday afternoon matinée"" diversion, it's entertaining enough.<br /><br />A slightly overweight Stephen Baldwin, in a follow-up to an even sillier 2006 sci-fi opus, ""Earth Storm"" about using bombs to put a crumbling moon back together, invents a weapon using ""dark matter"" (apparently a more photogenic, controllable version of anti-matter) and generatable thunderstorms. Naturally, things go awry, foolish military men make stupid, ill-considered snap judgements causing even greater problems, traitors steal the weapon and (reaching the heights of ""Marvel Comic silliness"") Baldwin absorbs some of the ""dark matter"", making himself a self-generating (but only defensive for some reason - until the villain does it) weapon! The big screen Spiderman films made as much scientific sense (why can't screenwriters give us entertainment with stories JUST as exciting that gets the science right and doesn't insult our intelligence!?) but had more consistent characters and motivations.<br /><br />If you can ignore the basically incredible weapon which is the McGuffin which gets the plot rolling, the piece is fun on its own terms - no worse than Disney's 1979 ""Black Hole"" (which famously made its title dark star a glowing whirlpool). The Disney had firmer scientific underpinnings but worse acting and special effects, so it's sort of a fair trade off.<br /><br />The always engaging Rob LaBelle makes a fine scientific sidekick (who actually does most of the work - not to mention acting), and Gardiner Millar as the chief villain is solid - even when the special effects have him reenacting the last scenes of the first Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />Undemanding fun, but keep your expectations low.",unsup

The narrator makes derogatory comments about everyone else, even those who arguably are not so different from McGovern (smart, well intentioned, often effective, and human). Most of the movie is interviews with participants, including McGovern himself, who still has all the traits that made him attractive 35 years ago, including honesty about his mistakes.

The special effects are better than most made-for-TV movies but do little to capture the imagination. There are bad guy minions in this movie that look like ninjas and a fair amount of scenes in which the character's voice inflection is completely inappropriate, not to mention the fact that instead of at least attempting to fake scientific jargon, lots of questions are answered with, ""I can't tell you that, it's classified,"" or ""it's so complicated, you wouldn't understand.""

Film's casting with Prem Chopra as a woman chaser, cheating, two timing villain, Bindu as a vamp, and a cabaret dancer, with that famous number, which includes a dialogue, Tumhara Nam kya hain, ya Madhu, and Rajesh and Asha in their hey days, is satisfactory. even Nassir Hussein as the father-in law, in love with his grandson, and compassionate to his widowed daughter-in-law, who is actually an imposter,by the strange twist of destiny, caused by an unfortunate train accident , delivers a sensitive performance . This movie is pleasant on the eyes too, with it's cinematography, and shooting of outside locations of a hill station, covering beautiful lakes, and greenery around the place, where the story takes place. Asha is a good actress, and her performance as a torn young woman, between her love towards Rajesh, and realization of the unfortunate role of a widow that she has to enact, in a prestigious, wealthy family, is really touching. Rajesh , in his usual stylized mannerisms, and some everlasting songs by kishore Kumar for him to enact on the screen, is adorable. Dialogues are well-written, and poignantly delivered . However, if only we overlook the clichéd situation, that Rajesh was the one, to whom Asha was supposed to be getting married, and elopes for the love of Prem Chopra, who is a bad man in the story, as well as the train accident, The father-in -law, who hasn't seen the girl to whom his son was married before, and Asha entrapped in a situation, to abide by the oath that she would take care of that orphaned baby etc. and finally, the truth dawning on her, that it's Rajesh, whom she had wronged unwittingly, but loves him now deeply, the movie is a passé. This movie made a fairly good business at the box, and most of the songs are still fresh in the people's memory. it also indicates to the problem of young girls eloping from their homes, and landing in trouble eventually.

The contribution of the versatile Gaur is very big in making Kati Patang a classic hit. Very few know that Shakti Samanta was Vrajendra Gaur's assistant in the only film directed by Gaur called ""Kasturi"". Gaur passed on all the subsequent offers to Shakti and returned to his first love writing. He subsequently wrote most of the films made by Shakti.

This movie's plot line can be summed up in one line: 'Rich guy falls for white trash woman for no reason.' Completely unappealing.",unsup
1106_0,"This excursion into a pivotal season of our history is essential viewing. Unfortunately our sense of history seems to be overwhelmed by our information overload brought to us at the speed of light. This well thought out, very personal film brings a refreshing blend of film making, story telling, and biography to bring out vast details, many of which went under the radar, of a complex time in our nation's history. George McGovern's life and presidential campaign became a catalyst for politics and political movements that are still reverberating to this day.<br /><br />The edit and design is organic, maintaining the feel of the period the story grew out of. You may be surprised of details you never knew about the man, stirred by memories of that season, or finally get some clarity as to how our current political culture arrived to the place it is now.",unsup
11070_0,"I love James Spader - that's why I sat through this movie - not once (years ago), but twice (very recently). Sure, he's gotten sort of doughy in recent years, and is now in that awful TV show, but in this movie he is just so damn appealing: the most expressive eyes, those succulent lips. Yum! Susan Sarandon, OTOH, is way overrated as both an actress and a sex symbol. First, she's not at all attractive physically. The big, baggy bug eyes bothered me most. I found her character repulsive, crude, pathetic and incredibly annoying. Her crackling laugh in the bar scene made me *so* want to smack her. Her desperate ""trapping"" of him at the bar was painful to watch. How sad that she had to get him plastered and dupe him into coming home with her. Then, she just about rapes him. He resists, but later decides it'll take less energy to just let her have her way with him. He seems disgusted with her the morning after, and leaves callously, saying he won't be back - YET, we're to believe that within the next day he's become smitten with her and discovered he can't live without her? PLEASE!! Age is not the issue. She's crude, classless, unlikeable, a filthy slob, a drunk and a disgusting chain-smoker, yet this handsome, wealthy,young, successful, opera-loving, and impeccably neat ""catch"" falls hopelessly in love with her. ABSURD!!! It James Spader weren't in it, this movie would have gotten a -10!",unsup

She takes him home, basically rapes him, ( I know, I know....he seemed to be enjoying it, didn't he?) and then all of a sudden he can't do without her? I'm not buying it. There is not one word - not one line - not one shred of respect, admiration, fondness, or friendship between them. There is not one scene that convinces you that they really are compatible in any way. You get the feeling he doesn't even LIKE her very much. They have great sex - no question. But this is supposed to be the basis of a life-changing relationship for him? It is so totally unbelievable. I like Susan Sarandon and I like James Spader. But they should have gone back to the drawing board on this one before they ever released it. The older woman/younger man story is great. But let's get some better dialog and at least a couple of scenes to convince us that there might be a real relationship here.",unsup
11072_0,"""White Palace"" is one of my favorite movies, and I am amazed at the negative comments about Susan Sarandon's armpits. They clearly are part of her character, and she is to be commended for going to the extra effort to fit herself into the part (exactly as Demi Moore did in ""We're No Angels""). Gillette created the woman-shaving fad in the 1930's as a successful effort to double their razor sales. Then in the late 60's, young women stopped wearing makeup and stopped shaving as part of ""the natural look."" In the early 1970's, the cosmetic companies unleashed a media blitz to get women away from this natural look. <br /><br />They were successful, and heavy makeup (even cartoonish) and shaving became a fad again. The current advertising in the U.S. is designed to make women feel insecure and unattractive. Then it tells them they can be acceptable and beautiful if they wear the latest (and most expensive) gunk, and scrape off every bit of body hair below their eyebrows. Women have completely bought into it. Personally, I like women to look natural and not wear thick makeup (or any, in fact); I feel that they are much prettier without it.",unsup

Nora shows to Max a new way to live the life based on her She has not an academic or professional background so impressive, but she has experience and intelligence. She resists everything except lies and hipocrisy. She show her pride, when Max try to give her a vacuum cleaner like a gift. The erotic scenes are a valuable part of the film. Nora will have difficulties with the friends of Max. The talks in the bathroom are very descriptive about how is she feeling that. Some political issues are pointed during the Thanksgiving party. Nora cannot control herself and standing up gives a speech in defence of the working class in front of that rich and powerful jewish family. The worst scene is almost at the end of the film, in a friend's house, when Max discovers the same model of vacuum cleaner without dust inside. (it's a bit pathetic) In fact it is a recommended film, specially for Sarandon fans (like me).",unsup

James Spader's acting ability is marginal at best, but here, he does a very effective and surprisingly understated job and he and Sarandon do make sparks (although Sarandon could make sparks all alone in a full-force hurricane!) as a couple in this. Very good romantic drama, despite the occasional mis-step. Recommended.<br /><br />",unsup

That was too much, and killed the glow of the ending for me. Still...an engrossing movie.",unsup

I actually tuned in because of James Spader... having just seen him in ""Secretary"" renewed my curiosity. I thought it was a very good movie, a classic example of money and a big house (and the ""perfect"" wife) not always bringing happiness. Mostly a feel good but definitely not just fluff -- wondered if I would find those two believable as a couple and ended up thinking they were a great match... Enjoy!",unsup

He's cute when he plays drunk, and even better when he's being molested by Susan Serandon... sp. By the way where was Jeremy Piven in this movie and if he was in it why didn't they try to put him in it more. He's a lot hotter than Jason Alexander, who by the way is really annoying. I know I don't watch movies because of people's looks but if it wasn't for Spader I'd have never seen this one... It was cute. Thanks and farewell.",unsup
11078_0,"Who says love has to be a certain way? This movie doesn't. ""White Palace"" is a very moving and sexually energetic movie that shows you can be happy in your own way. Max(James Spader) is an executive in advertising who was brought down by the death of his wife. After a raucous bachelor party, he goes to a bar on the wrong side of town, and there he meets Nora(Susan Sarandon), a worker at White Palace, who refunded Max earlier, asks him what he's doing at this place. Both go home smashed, but as Max dreams of his wife, Nora makes her move on him. Man, she's 43, and he's a 27-year-old yuppie. The sex gets good there. Both of them feel alive, and the tension start to mount. His friends want him to be happy, but Max wants to be happy in his way. His friend at the bachelor party Neil(Jason Alexander), wants to set him up with some that had the hots for Max. He declined. His friend's wife will do anything to play matchmaker. Playing matchmaker will either bring happiness, or cause misery. Neil, his wife and all of Max's friends needed to learn one thing, is to mind their own businesses. Those folks need to stop running people's lives. If it haven't been Nora's sister Judy(Eileen Brennan), those two wouldn't been any happier.

She didn't run away to New York though, but if she did I would have chased her down like Max did. Long story short,a great movie. The realism in the relationship throughout the movie was superb. Also I liked how Nora stood her ground during the Thanksgiving dinner, much like my fiancée's defensive attitude was towards my family. Definitely a movie worth watching.",unsup
1107_0,"""One Bright Shining Moment"" is the kick in the butt reality of what this country is, and what we should all inspire to become. Beginning with problems with the Vietnam war, George McGovern is a man who truly would have altered history as we know it. Or has he? Stephen Vittoria tells the remarkable tale of a man who, even in his eighties, could run rings around the present day administration. With great narrative by Amy Goodman and unmistakable interviews with Gore Vidal and Warren Beatty, being ""progressive"" takes on the dictionary's true definition. <br /><br />For example, progressive means moving forward and advancing. Proceeding in steps and continuing steadily by increments, or promoting and favoring progress toward better conditions or new policies, ideas, and methods.<br /><br />It is my opinion that this film is a mentor of hope and should be passed along to EVERY young person in this once great land of ours! I only wish my history class was this enjoyable.",unsup

11081_0,"This is a straightforward and touching film, and a treat for anyone who enjoys watching actors - especially either of these two - playing small scale scenes recognisable from every day life. They play well together and I suspect the way the director enabled them to work had a hand in this. Unusually, the film is set in St. Louis.<br /><br />The film is often under rated and its central relationship derided as implausible. I believe this is unfair and misses the point of the film.<br /><br />It's a simple tale of class, differing social milieu and how people's social circles influence the choices we make in life. This couple resolve these issues by moving to another city, but not all of us can so readily choose this option.<br /><br />Is their relationship implausible? Well aside from the obvious point that Susan Sarandon (Nora,) looks radiant most of the time, and probably never looked better on film, Spader's character (Max,) is not quite as preppy as he appears, and has more in common with Nora than first meets the eye. There is of course, their shared grief, but Max's mother(Edith,) appears in two scenes, and she is, I believe, a key to understanding their relationship.<br /><br />Edith has a Brooklyn type accent which points to Max having something of a working class background himself, and further, he has ambivalent feelings towards her - for one thing, she is uncomfortable in formal social settings. I think these suggest that Max's attraction to Nora is not nearly as left field as it may appear. Further, I see a facial similarity between the actors, especially around the eyes and mouth, which social psychologists often cite as a predictor of couple attraction.<br /><br />As to whether the film is any good...? I think it portrays the joys, tensions and compromises of the early stages of a relationship very convincingly. They have a lot of sex, they have rows, they make up, they meet each other's friends, they annoy each other, they work their way through issues. It's not War and Peace, but it does reflect every day life quite consonantly. It has some inspired comic touches - ""the sandwich"" springs to mind - a solid chemistry between the two stars, and some touching pieces of observation such as when Max tenderly explores Nora's belongings reminiscently of Garbo in Queen Christina.<br /><br />If you fancy a touching love story, well acted, with stand back and don't get in the way direction, and with gentle undercurrents of social commentary, then The White Palace is worth a shot. If you check the voting for it, you'll see that quite a few people agree with me!",unsup
11082_0,"I liked James Spader's performance; demonstrating as it does a vulnerable quality I didn't know he had. All those wistful looks off into the distance, and the general aura of a man beaten down by life make for something that  I have to say - is pretty touching! This softer element he brings to the part was a nice change from seeing him do the sleazeball routine for the umpteenth time... The movie itself is reminiscent of Pretty Woman in spots, and is a pleasant surprise. An offbeat sleeper on Sarandon's resume.<br /><br />It's got that whole 'you can't rationalise who you love' motif, which I'm all too aware of, in my everyday living... (of course)<br /><br />The whole 'keeping things around for show as an empty token of status' philosophy of some of the protagonists pals is a nice comment on the world of yuppie superficiality that James Spader's characters themselves have often been found immersed in. The movie could easily have been just another bland melodrama, but these themes provide a refreshing and unexpected counterpoint.",unsup
11083_0,"While I don't believe the end result for a second, this film will do whatever it takes to make us believe the relationship between 44 year old Nora Baker and 27 year old Max Baron can work. The age-gap isn't as difficult to accept as their ethnic and financial differences. Baron is a wealthy, successful Jewish business exec and Nora is a waitress at a hamburger joint. The film, though, with all it's might, tries to make us believe that, yes, they can still maintain a loving relationship despite all the certain trials that lie ahead. Both have had loss in their life, both find each other attractive, and when they are together the chemistry and passion is simply magnetic. It's the idea of who and what they are outside the personal relationship.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon's performance as the waitress is a winner because she shows her as fearless, dynamic, and flawed..but she doesn't ask for pity and accepts that life doesn't always deal everyone a great hand. She goes after the younger man, loves him, she is thankful he continues coming by her house to stay. That aggressiveness to go after what she wants without worrying about what others might say(..though, she is very vulnerable and doesn't have faith in the strength of the relationship lasting). Spader finally has a chance to portray a likable character who just wants to feel something again. With Nora, he has that joy and the stars are aligned.<br /><br />I will say that this film has lots of things going for it. The dialogue does allow Sarandon to expand her character beyond a cliché. You like her despite whatever faults you might see glaringly. Spader is able to expand into uncharted territory as a person we can care about instead of loathe. There's also a marvelous supporting cast which fill the film with color. But, startlingly, this film is also sexually passionate and pulls no punches showing the animal attraction these two have for each other.",unsup
11084_0,"there are very few romance or romantic comedies, which strike a real note for the audience, or anyone who appreciates reality and decent acting.<br /><br />This film does have that. Sarandon is very good; she is a ""down-at-heel"" waitress, almost twenty years older than the character portrayed by Spader. Some of the interactions are amusing and sad. Her drinking, her loss of a child. Spader's background is respectable, white-collar but bored, he meets Sarandon after missing his deceased wife.<br /><br />Films like this are sometimes underrated. There was not a lot of hype about this film, which is one of the reasons I like it (We do not need Hollywood to tell us what's good, i.e. ""The Break Up"", which was actually not good).<br /><br />While the scenes with Spader's relatives were a bit stereotyped, overall there are a few good messages here. Life doesn't always work out how we want, ""perfect couples"" aren't necessarily happy, and the Spader character was actually quite good, not being the negative insensitive character here. Definitely worth viewing. 8/10.",unsup
11085_0,"Having already commented on this one once, I had to comment again as I just watched it again for the umpeenth time. I had rated this about an 8, it's actually more like a 9 and one of my top 50 movies ever. I know everyone has a right to their opinion but this movie is so little known I truly hope at least one person reads some POSITVE reviews on here and gives it a shot.<br /><br />I do NOT think Sarandon looked unattractive here as people have said but if she did, it really doesn't matter because the focus of the story has little to do with physical attractiveness. The theme here is love-and loving who YOU want to love versus who your friends, family and society wants you to. It's also about identity and about finding out that the person you truly are maybe quite different then who you always thought you were. The film brings to life the characters in the amazing book(I'd recommend the book version of this as well, it's even better then the film). Sarandon gives a luminous performance as Nora, she's the only actress I could ever see in the role anyway. The film is tragic, touching, gloriously acted and brings up some interesting issues of love and identity. I'm amazed this pic isn't better known, I agree very much with Ebert's review particularly(SPOILER)<br /><br />The last scene that kind of does take credibility away fro the rest of the pic but then again-it maybe a little to Hollywood but the movie did (somewhat) follow the book's ending which was also positive although nowhere near the film's last scene.<br /><br />I would recommend this to everyone particularly Sarandon fans, fans of the romance Genre, fans of Dramas in General or just people who like to dig up films that are kind of little known. Every time I see this I like it just a little bit more.",unsup

The loss and love Spader communicates with just his eyes is a sight to behold and Sarandon projects a dichotomy of neediness and strength.<br /><br />This movie contains one of the best endings in movie history, right up there with Green Card.

A perfectly happy end.<br /><br />The reason why I watched this movie was because I'm truly one of the biggest Susan Sarandon fans. She shines absolutely beautiful in this movie.And James Spader has performed one of his bests roles ever. my favourite scene is when Nora (Susan) meets one of Max(James)'s Friends, Sherri.She asks Nora ""you know our max is quite a catch. How Did you manage it?"" and Nora says:""I give a good b***job I guess"" Sherri : Hmmmmm.. I bet you do""and Nora answers: ""And I bet you don't"" You must see the look on Sherri's face<br /><br />I think it's a great movie because normally hollywood is afraid of a love story about a young man and an older woman.There should be more of those movies because some people think it's strange when a older woman has a love relation with a much younger man. ( I've never thought it was strange and I'm only a fifteen year old girl) But most people find it absolutely normal when an old man has something with a much younger woman.

The old saying is true - in order to know our future we must know our past. This film shines a bright light on the life of George McGovern and his failed attempt to win the 1972 Presidential election.<br /><br />Not necessarily a household name for today's generation, McGovern represented the idealism of American politics and it's fair to say we haven't seen anyone like him since.<br /><br />McGovern's victory in the Democratic primary was nothing short of astonishing. A Senator from South Dakota running against 16 other candidates for the Democtratic nomination, he amazingly won and set off to battle against Nixon in the Presidential election. After a series of unfortunate events (the shooting of George Wallace) and self-described campaign errors, Nixon won in a landslide.<br /><br />The film uses archival footage, interviews with political historians, influential political activities from the time period (e.g. Dick Gregory, Gloria Steinam, Warren Beatty, Gary Hart) and candid interviews with Senator McGovern. Blended with an excellent musical score, the film is not to be taken lightly.<br /><br />With obvious parallels between Nixon and today's Bush Administration, it's hard not to get wrapped up in the idealism of ""what if?"", had McGovern won the election.<br /><br />Senator McGovern is a spry 83 years old at the time of this review, with an intellect as sharp as ever. On the sad day when he passes, this film will serve as a tribute to his idealism and accomplishments during one of the blackest hours of American history.<br /><br />Here's hoping the film will indeed be used as a teaching tool in high schools and colleges around the country.<br /><br />ebhp",unsup

Harry gets a tape to the husband which explains that if he wants to know where his wife is buried he must not contact the police and pay him the amount of money he asks for, or Harry will never tell where she is. Well of course like in every movie the husband goes to the police. In a wicked awesome chase scene Harry is captured, but keeps to his word of never telling the woman's where abouts. Maura Tierney is the only person Harry says he will talk to. As soon as she sits down the police are taken on a wild goose chase by the brilliant young killer.

This wasn't a ""buried alive movie"". The lack of Oxygen aspect was a sub plot to what was happening between Tierney and Brody, Tierney and Kinney, and Tierney and her... Friend??? Until reading other users comments I didn't realise it was a ""small town production"". In the hands of the Silence of the Lambs crew this would have been a big psycho thriller. More would have been made of the ""Alone"" interview, which could have been a precursor to a much more masochistic violent ending. This film was a few rewrites short of being a very good film.

11093_0,"Oxygen starts one sunny afternoon in New York City as Frances Hannon (Laila Robins) is walking her pet dog around the block, a man (Adrien Brody) approaches her a begins to chat to her, at first he seems a pleasant & charming young man but he soon changes as he becomes aggressive, he threatens her & makes her get into a nearby car. He, & his accomplice (Michael Henderson), drive off to a wood where they bury Frances alive in a wooden coffin, she has about 24 hours worth of air left & the clock is ticking... Detective Madeline Foster (Maura Tierney) & her partner Jesse (Paul Calderon) are called onto the task force to find Frances & apprehend her kidnappers. They are both briefed, Frances rich husband Clarke (James Naughton) has received a videotape that demands he pay a $1,000,000 ransom or Frances will be left to suffocate & die an agonising & terrifying death. The money drop off goes OK until the kidnapper figures out the police are watching him, Foster has no choice but to arrest him without the knowledge of where Frances is & once in custody he refuses to say anything, will Frances be found in time before she runs out of air & why does her young kidnapper seem so clam, almost as if he is enjoying himself or maybe there are other less clear motives behind the events of the previous day...<br /><br />Written, co-produced & directed by Richard Shepard I thought Oxygen was a nice tight, taut little thriller that isn't the sort of thing I usually like but it has a certain something about it. The script at it's most basic is pretty gripping & absorbing as time runs out for Frances while Harry the kidnapper toys with the police & FBI, although I have to say once Harry is arrested & stuck in that room the pace slackens considerably. I would say that what Oxygen deals with is what many would consider their worst nightmare, being buried alive & slowly running out of air & perhaps more could have been done with this concept as it concentrates a little too much on the games played by Harry with the authorities. One more thing, Harry's precise & exact plans rely far too much on luck & things he simply has no control over to make me convinced that he could have come up with such an elaborate & implausible scheme. I mean his whole plan is based on the fact that he would be placed in one room, in that they would handcuff him in a certain way & that he would definitely be able to pick the locks, that they would agree with his demands to the absolute letter & that there is a air conditioning vent in the room just big enough to crawl through & that he could actually reach it as well as being able to keep total control over a hostage so they don't raise the alarm. That's an awful lot of coincidences & a whole lot of luck as well. The character's are well developed & fleshed out, they have a little bit more depth than usual I loved the monologue about the lethal injection from the FBI agent who was meant to be intimidating.<br /><br />Director Shepard does an OK job without being particularly outstanding, as a whole Oxygen is a little bland & forgettable but the solid story should paper over the lacklustre visuals. The film lacks any real tension or excitement but it does retain ones interest throughout, again thanks to the story. There isn't any violence to speak of except a gory gunshot wound at the end.<br /><br />Technically Oxygen is OK, it's competently made, there are a few nice New York shots & a couple of minor car chases although there isn't much action as it's a dialogue & storyline driven film. The acting is good especially from the two leads, Tierney as the cop & the effective Brody as the cold, calculating villain.<br /><br />Oxygen is a good thriller, it's short on action or violence but it has a good strong story to compensate. Personally I think it's well worth a watch.",unsup

It's such a great improvement on the usual hackneyed crap put out by Hollywood that it's hard not to like it a lot.

1109_0,"What you didn't know about Senator George McGovern and presidential candidate George McGovern is captured by director Stephen Vittoria in this documentary which should be required viewing by all who care about our country and our election process. But it's far more. It's the story of how a distinguished professor of history, with all the values and integrity that we would like to attribute to those who enter politics and determine much of our destiny, sacrifices a secure and magnificent life with his family, for that which might make our country safer, more respected, and less corrupt. He does this because he believes it can be done to save the lives of those young Americans dying needlessly in an unjustifiable war in Vietnam. And he does it so that he and his family and all Americans can have real hope for the future. That's what we wanted then, that's what we hoped for in our leaders then, and that's, oddly what we still want so desperately in this perilous world now. There are moments in the film that remind us of things you will recall or be fascinated to know because you didn't really know the truth then. Some of what you had thought, which you will see, was totally false. You'll not only learn of the frailty of our democracy due to television, election time, commercial spots but with 20-20 hindsite, you'll see how we, the American voters, were tricked. The comic, genius of political observation, Dick Gregory, and so many magificant observers of history in the film provide intelligent even humorous observations about our lives and our system of government. It really doesn't matter what side you're on. Considering where we find ourselves today, where our nation's young soldiers, men and women are fighting in Iraq, the film tells us, bluntly that we have not really learned, or grown, or done much about our historic blunders. It's shocking. In the time of George McGovern's presidential bid against President Nixon, who would later resign in disgrace (lest he be impeached and thrown out of office), we had a choice. We could correct the mistakes of how we go into war, in Vietnam under two administrations (Johnson and Nixon), in which lost us 60,000 Americans, and wounded so many more, or we could ""stay the course,"" as we do today. This extraordinary look into our past is like a roadmap to the future. It demonstrates how the nature of American politics does not change nomatter how obvious the truth is, particularly delivered by a 500-1 shot as was McGovern. Senator McGovern, for over a decade, had opposed our involvement in the war in Vietnam and pledged, above all, that if elected he would bring our troops home and end the senseless deaths of our young and brave men and women, fighting soldiers. This film is a tribute to a man, a former fighter pilot (35 missions in WWII), a respected senator from South Dakota and candidate for the presidency. Smear tactics from Nixon's party's CREEP, that will shock you and amaze you, and even the strange occurrences related to the attempted assassination of George Wallace will make your jaw drop. But through it all Senator McGovern had hope and gave the working people hope, the poor and isolated people hope where none had existed since the days of President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. You'll see images and hear words of that time when it was marvelous to have someone with the courage. And you'll see the power of a political machine that constantly tried to crush him. I ask you to find this film. Order it online in DVD when it's out. Read the interview in VENICE MAGAZINE (written by Alex Simon and published by Nancy Bishop). This is so important to all of us if we are ever to have hope again about our nation and our leaders. And it's as appropriate now because we are again locked in a front page war that was so similar. Don't rob yourself of this great film about one great man who would have made a difference in this nation's course. There aren't many but it gives us a slim sense of hope that there might be someone to renew our hope again and make American all that we want it to be and make us safe.",unsup
110_0,"After reading the positive comments here and seeing the 1 star rating on my digital cable guide, I decided to give it a chance (plus, I'm a big Alan Arkin fan after seeing him in 'Catch-22', 'Glengarry Glen Ross', and 'Little Murders'). And I have to say that it's not as bad as it's made out to be. It's actually really really funny--if you have a certain sense of humor. I was dying with laughter during the scene where Arkin and Rob Reiner started fighting on the father's bed--on top of the father! There were other good scenes: the kids throwing the rocks through the windows, Arkin approaching the basketball player on the court, the crazy Jewish mother throughout the whole movie, ""Keep Out Putz!"" written on the office door and the scene with the comatose dad and the insurance guys. I could go on because I really liked this movie. The only thing that kinda bugged was Rob Reiner's attacks, but eh. What are you gonna do?<br /><br />I think that you have to enjoy a certain type of humor to find this movie funny. During the whole thing I found myself drawing parallels to my favorite sitcom, Arrested Development. Crazy dysfunctional family? Check. Adopting a kid of a completely different race for personal gain? Check. Buring down a business for money? Check. (Episode 2 of Season 1--Top Banana!) Multiple story lines that culminate into one big finale? Yup. And there was even a big wacky ending involving all the family members. Both are very slapstick-y comedies with both dry and over the top jokes. If you love that kind of humor, then you'll really like Fire Sale. If you're more into standard comedies, then you'll probably become very easily annoyed and change the channel.<br /><br />I'd love to see a cheap DVD of this movie out in a letterbox format. I remember Fox Movie Channel used to run some kind of promo trailer/short documentary before showing it, so I'd love to see that as well. Plus, some of the scenes are very dark. I'm not sure if this is the print of the movie or Arkin's intention, but it would be nice to see this movie remastered and released in the future, but that probably won't happen. A girl can dream though!",unsup
11100_0,"I expected so little from this small movie with its no-name cast that I gave it my usual 20-minute test. (If a movie doesn't grab me in 20 minutes, can it.)<br /><br />Was I surprised! Although a low-budget film, the acting was quite good & Richard Shepard (who wrote & directed) did an excellent job, grabbing interest quickly & sustaining it.<br /><br />The bad guy, Harry, at first seemed a simple-minded villain. However, although he was distinctly good at being an obnoxious sociopath (the terms do not always go in tandem, the seemingly affable Ted Bundy is a one example), he DID become far more interesting than I imagined -- much smarter than one would have suspected. We're talking gut smart, instinct smart, perhaps even intuitively keen. His ability to 'read' Madeline, to ferret out her true persona, to observe him honing in on her psychological dysfunction was fascinating.<br /><br />From the get-go, Madeline has your attention. Is she simply a cop driven to serve society & keep the ordinary citizen safe? Partially. Then we discover Madeline's secret side, a side her husband doesn't see but Harry latches onto almost immediately.<br /><br />I do remember stories of people being buried alive, especially since I'm old enough to have seen the original Vincent Price movies when first released & am familiar with the Poe fears and stories. As the victim, Frances (played very well by Laila Robins) is sealed in a wooden coffin covered with dirt somewhere apparently so isolated nobody near can hear her dog's insistent barking. Her fear is palpable & comes across with brutal reality. You hope she will survive -- but the outcome is questionable as time ticks agonizingly slow for her but too quickly for those trying to ensure her rescue. It's Einstein's relativity theory embodied in this very tense situation.<br /><br />On the debit side, more could have been done with her husband. His character was shunted aside too much for my taste: what kind of relationship did they have & why was he so unaware of her darker side? An alcoholic problem is addressed fleetingly, but as any member of a 12-step group would know, one has to reach a base understanding of motivation to move ahead. Maybe they hadn't attended enough meetings.<br /><br />Summing up, 'Oxygen' was a surprising treat. It pulls you in quickly, deals quite well with complex situations. Although I shun violence, found myself wanted to applaud a violent act which I personally consider not to be an exception in real life.",unsup

Though the script was weak in places, it was an interesting idea and very suspenseful. Leads Tierney, who played Madeline Foster, and Adrien Brody, who played Harry, were phenomenal. Their ability to encompass their complex characters and become them, plus the chemistry between the two, helped carry the story. I can't picture any other actors in those roles, and I think if you took away even one of them, the movie would be weaker. In short, this was an excellent movie, mainly because of Tierney and Brody. I'd give the story overall an 8, but just the sheer talent of the leads caused me to boost my vote to a 9.",unsup

The connection that developed between Brody and Madeline( forgot her real name) was intense, and if you can't see how their deepest desires are somewhat the same then you won't understand the movie.

11107_0,"This is a pretty fair ""neo-noir"" presentation, which I'd missed hearing about during the nine years since its release - but found in my paper's local-edition weekly t.v. listings. They only gave it 1-1/2*'s, but noticing that Adrien Brody and Maura Tierney were in the cast, I decided to take a look. One of the best aspects of this flick is the character each represents - two of the most weirdly fascinating, this side of Dennis Hopper and his companions ""Blue Velvet,"" or the cult classic Rory Calhoun opus, ""Motel Hell."" Brody as the youthful, sort of nerdy-yet-wicked, braces-wearing, nefarious villain; and Tierney as the competent, dedicated, tough detective, with her strange compulsive, secretive nocturnal predilections, sort of a ""masochistic savant."" <br /><br />Perhaps not great, and with some contrasting moments. Sometimes the cops here were more realistic and ""low-key"" than in most of this type of movie fare, and at others were the types of doophuses we see regularly, enforcing the law, in these flicks.<br /><br />All-in-all, a good 7* presentation, and not a bad way to spend the two hours' viewing.<br /><br />As a sort of imaginary ""sub-plot"" I couldn't help visualizing from early-on, I was hoping that Brody and Tierney might meet-up at some point - the confrontation between the quintessential sadist and masochist, respectively. I thought of dialog between them, replicating a joke I once heard: the masochist says to the sadist, ""Hit me!"" (or, alternatively, ""Hurt me!""). The sadist replies, ""NO!!"" (When they finally met in the interrogation room, there were a couple of occasions when I thought this just might occur.)",unsup

The story is not really Award-worthy - young, brilliant criminal buries the wife of a rich man to get some money, and then he gets interrogated by a female cop. But the actors are just great - Adrien Brody shows his evil face and you got really scared of him, and Maura Tierney... We know that she can play, we saw it a thousand times at ER, but the role of the depressive, drinking cop seems to fit her absolutely perfect. You just have to watch her throwing her life away, getting pulled in that turmoil of herself deeper with every minute. You want to save her, but you know, even if you had the possibility to get to know her in real life, you couldn't, because in a sick way it fascinates you to just watch. And the chemistry between her and Brody is amazing - after the first meeting of both you are not able to turn this movie out.

McGovern's inherent decency cost him one of the nation's most crucial Presidential elections in 1972, running against the original king of dirty tricks, Richard Milhouse Nixon. Although McGovern's platform was somewhat vindicated when Nixon's White House was outed by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as the most corrupt administration in American history (with Tricky Dick's resignation soon following), the tragedy of his loss, and his subsequent fade into the background of American history still resonates.<br /><br />Hopefully our best and brightest young people will see this film and will be inspired by Sen.

11111_0,"Oxygen is one of those truly rare surprises. A thriller that offers great performances from a ""lesser known"" cast, chases, twists and turns, and an overall satisfying story.<br /><br />Director Richard Shepard had offers of a larger budget but it would have meant having it done the way the higher-ups in suits would have wanted it done. By managing to get several producers on the project, he was allowed to do the film the way he wanted and actually pulled off a fun thriller on a little over a million dollars for the budget. A wealthy sociallite is kidnapped, buried alive, and a ransom is demanded to reveal her location--but she has less than 24 hours, that is, if the air in her makeshift coffin lasts that long. There's a lot of talking going on in the process of saving her, but hey, figure how it would happen in real life, and for those looking for some thinking material as well as thrills, this plot works just fine. Besides, to me the most terrifying thing I can imagine is suffocating or drowning, and the idea of being buried alive like in this film is genuinely creepy.<br /><br />Maura Tierney plays the cop role with much seriousness, Adrien Brody is so off kilter you forget he's actually a decent guy in real life (as revealed on the DVD's audio commentary), but big points go to Laila Robins as the woman buried alive--her character is so convincing she makes you feel uneasy to the point of squirming in your seat. There's a stunning car chase as well to satisfy action enthusiasts, but it's within context and not just another cheap thrill to fill up time. And just when you think things are about to finish, a really big wrench is thrown in to twist the story even more and have you thinking, ""Wait just a darn minute....""<br /><br />I found viewing the DVD a much more satisfying experience, as you get the widescreen version and better quality picture. The audio commentary is quite informative and even informal, as the director points out a tiny judgment mishap in which a scene was shot early with the actors wearing jackets, but the rest of the film surrounding that scene everyone is made to look like they're sweating from the hot weather. Considering I was originally enthralled with the story, I really didn't notice that until listening to the commentary. The DVD also has an interesting storyboard sequence for the car chase scene, with commentary. For a lesser known film with a small budget, there was quite a bit of care put in this release.<br /><br />Give yourself a treat and check this film out. Consider this: Sometimes it's more fun to try a film that's not a big market blockbuster instead of having to only go with a ""top 10"" title. Just because a film has big stars and is pushed as a ""hot new release"" in a video store doesn't mean anything (goodness, haven't you learned that by now, folks?). Oxygen is one of those great little surprises that will have you saying, ""Gee, why didn't I give this one a try earlier?""",unsup
11112_0,"This made for TV psychological crime thriller exceeded my expectations. The story begins with the abduction of a rich wife for ransom. She is buried alive and her abductor sets about collecting the ransom for the location of her grave. However, this is really not the story but only the set up. The real story is about what happens after he is caught as the police and the FBI race against time to get him to reveal where she's buried.<br /><br />Our sociopathic villain, known to us only as Harry (after his idol Harry Houdini) is well prepared for the psychological cat and mouse game that follows as he had planned what he would do if he were caught. The result is an effective (though often superficial) contest of psychological one upsmanship between Harry (Adrien Brody) and our heroine police detective, Madeline (Maura Tierney).<br /><br />The story has some noticeable plot flaws for a film that is attempting to be a serious crime drama. Certain elements of Harry's escape attempts are implausible. Much of the dialogue between the police officers and FBI agents was inane drivel that made them look like idiots. There are other problems later in the story involving the buried wife that are also troubling. These are not enough, however, to mar an otherwise well crafted plot.<br /><br />I was most impressed by the photography, not just the look of the film, but the way the images presented themselves. Director Richard Shepard used the camera very creatively, using objects in foreground and background to dramatize certain images. There was an excellent shot of Madeline's reflection seen in extreme close-up in Harry's eye. The handheld chase scenes made you feel like you were running behind the action. This is a level of directing that is not normally seen on TV. The whole film had a very raw, real look. Things were dirty and disorganized, just like in real life rather than being carefully and symmetrically placed.<br /><br />The acting ranged from fair to excellent. The cops and the husband were generally pretty mediocre with moments of nausea. Maura Tierney was good but didn't have the range to play Madeline effectively. Madeline's character required a combination of tormented, pathetic self abuser and case hardened cop. Tierney was outstanding at the tormented side, but came across as tentative and flaccid as the cop (which was the greater part of the role).<br /><br />The best performance comes from Adrian Brody as Harry. He was wry and unsophisticated while being just close enough to the edge to keep you guessing if he was cunning or just a psychopath. He played the part with sarcastic disdain, as if the character thought he was smarter than he really was, which indeed was the case.<br /><br />Terry Kinney's character, Madeline's cop husband Tim, didn't give him much to work with. He was a wimpy whining loser. Kinney did an adequate job at this portrayal.<br /><br />I rated this movie 7/10. For those who enjoy a psychological crime thriller, it won't disappoint.<br /><br />",unsup

Tierney & Brody give wonderful performances in each of their roles and the direction is almost spotless.

The story is good, but would have suffered in the hands of a less competent director and cast. This is a movie that depends a lot on performance to deliver, and it does. Some of the supporting cast could have been played by better actors, but they are serviceable and are mostly meant to occasionally prod the story along another notch. On the whole, the cast stays out of the way of Brody and Tierney, who are the whole show. It's definitely worth seeing, and another one of those films that seemingly came out of nowhere, as I never heard of it before. I like solid B movies, and this stands out as one of the best.

In some desperate attempts to thicken the unoriginal plot, there's the lame sub plot about a nosy journalist and his ugly girlfriend going undercover in the company and the awkward story about the Corporate Executive (David Gale from ""Re-Animator"" fame) who injects the veins in his neck with the same liquids as the robots need in able to function. ""Syngenor"" is nearly unendurable nonsense, made on a shoestring budget and featuring no redeeming elements whatsoever, apart from the over-the-top performance of David Gale. The supposedly extraordinary killer robots, meant to replace human soldiers to fight wars in the Middle East, are actually very deficient machines! They can't deal with fire or water, and they're pretty easy to kill if you just aim well or hit them over the head hard enough. On top of that, they only last 24 hours before incubating their own successors. And these faulty metal things are supposed to be the future of the US Army? He's dead now, but I'm sure Saddam Houssein wouldn't have been impressed. The first half is still remotely amusing, since the inept dialogs and cheesy massacres supply the film with a handful of chuckles, but then the whole thing gets too stupid to even smile at. The climax battles are exaggeratedly retarded, with a very Terminator-esquire sequence in which the leftover pieces of one of the robots melt together with human tissue, resulting in an ultra-hideous robot-woman creature. What the hell was that? My rating of 3 out of 10 is extremely generous, mainly just because David Gale was a cool dude who never got the good roles he deserved, apart from once in ""Re-Animator"".",unsup

If their lives are so difficult, I recommend that they get off the stage and go to a part of the world where they can witness real suffering.

11120_0,"Where the whole world is holding its breath because of the upcoming 2004 election, it is refreshing to watch this TV series. Not only because of the superb acting of Pamela Reed & Michael Murphy and each and every one of the ensemble (something we almost take for granted with Altman pictures, which always give sublime acting) and the great writing, but also because it gives non-Americans some insight in Political USA.<br /><br />Inspiring and clarifying, it makes one wonder first of all why it's always the wrong movie people that get elected in politics. Wouldn't we all be much more relaxed if USA politics had a bit of the Altman-touch to it...<br /><br />Unfortunately, the inspiration of this Maverick doesn't seem to reach the oligarchy in power. Altman DOES show us that TV can be fascinating and uplifting, even though he got curtailed, which will keep us wondering how that 12th episode that was never shot would be like.<br /><br />Does this TV-series, which is over before one knows it and doesn't seem to take the 12x 30 minutes it says on the DVD jewelbox, draw a true picture of political USA ? Being from Europe I sincerely hope not, but I'm afraid it is even worse than Tanner is showing us.

11121_0,"A long-time Altman fan, I rented the video of Tanner 88 just in time for the final days of the 2000 election. In fact, on election night, I was flipping back and forth between Altman's clever take on presidential politics and the ""real"" thing, and I can tell you, Tanner 88 was much better television.<br /><br />The mini-series of 10 half-hour episodes is available on three VHS tapes.<br /><br />It was excellent, overall. Especially good was the way it punctured so many of the hot-air balloons and pretensions of American politics, but clearly sympathized with the people who want to believe in it. We see a liberal Democratic candidate, Jack Tanner, played skillfully by Michael Murphy, go through a campaign from the New Hampshire primary to the end of the convention. Typical of the series, Tanner is on the one hand shallow and full of empty rhetoric, while also sincere, idealistic and sometimes inspiring. Tanner's campaign manager, a woman, is also extremely smart, more than a little cynical, but capable of being inspired by her candidate whose weaknesses she knows very well. The first half of the series, which takes place in New Hampshire, is extremely funny, especially in showing how the citizens there have become inured to the hoopla of the candidates and the media. Also outstanding in this series is the way the working press is portrayed as part of the life of the campaign--these are real people, not just role players. The last two episodes, at the convention, lack the bite of the first five or or six, and could be skipped without losing much.",unsup
11122_0,"After a contentious decade for Robert Altman, during which he was pretty much shunned by the Hollywood system and made some of his worst films, it's only fitting that he should cap the decade off with an absolute triumph, this absorbing mini-series made for HBO.<br /><br />I don't know why it took so long for someone to pair ""Doonesbury"" writer Garry Trudeau with Altman, because in retrospect, it seems like a match made in heaven. Both have the exact same sarcastic sense of humor and the talent for seeing the absurd in the mundane. They crafted a fascinating look into the world of political machinations, following the story of fictitious 1988 presidential candidate Jack Tanner but setting it against the real world of the democratic primaries. Therefore, actual members of the political scene at the time interact with star Michael Murphy as if he's a real presidential nominee, and the viewer is never sure what action is authentic and what is staged.<br /><br />Murphy is superb as Tanner, and he's perfectly cast. Tanner is handsome and charismatic enough to make a fairly successful run for the nomination, but he's too bland and too nice to make it all the way. The series examines one of the major conundrums about American politics: to have a candidate with conviction and good ideas isn't enough. He must also be a personality and be able to navigate the tricky terrain of the American media, with the result that those who go farthest are those who know how to work the system, not those who are most honest. ""Tanner '88"" captured perfectly my own feelings about presidential elections. On the one hand, they're of supreme importance, because they determine who will be the leader of one of the most powerful nations in the world. But on the other hand, they seem like such pointless exercises, and it's hard to muster up the energy to care time after time.<br /><br />But one of the strongest and most serious points made by this series comes in an episode in which Tanner visits the slums of Detroit in his home state of Michigan. He realizes that he is completely out of touch with the very people he promises to help, and has no clue about what their lives are really like. That's painfully true about our own leadership -- it was in 1988 and still is today. There's a vast and probably insurmountable gap between the privileged few who ever have the remotest hope of being president and the millions of average Americans over whom they govern.<br /><br />All of the acting in ""Tanner '88"" is sensational, to the point where I forgot I wasn't just watching real people being filmed by a documentary filmmaker. Most notable are Pamela Reed, as Tanner's campaign manager, Cynthia Nixon, as his overbearing and very young daughter, and E.G. Marshall, who makes a few memorable appearances as Tanner's awful father.<br /><br />This is a must see for Altman fans, or really anyone with an interest in American politics.<br /><br />Grade: A+",unsup
11123_0,"Robert Altman and Gary Tredeau were a good match, and according to the DVD interview it makes a lot more sense than the simple notion of 'well, Doonsbury is a funny comic, Altman makes some funny movies.' As the two say and agree upon, it has to do with scenes, the behavior allotted not in a very rigid story structure but in what can be done just in one scene. Although the structure has to fit into half hour time slots, it's as epic in its own area as Altman's own Short Cuts, or even Band of Brothers in creating a world unto itself, as stark and true as possible to being there in person. As it ends up happening with Altman there are scenes that get cut into other scenes, perfectly, without a beat missed. Oh, sometimes a door closes and a door opens sort of cut might happen, which is fine, but as far as editing goes- which Altman says is when he starts to get much more in control as opposed to the loose approach to letting actors improvise (and with this, aside from the back-room scenes and really specific ones, there's a lot of it even for a production like Altman's)- it's much stronger than for a regular television show.<br /><br />Which is interesting since it sometimes has that long feeling of an Altman shot here and there, or one that is held for longer than one might expect in a TV show; one crucial shot being when Jack Tanner (Michael Murphy) is shot unawares by a camera looking through a glass coffee table as he gives a passionate monologue to his campaign team after a bad day. Shots like these, or when two characters have a conversation for a stretch of time (i.e. Tanner and the governor Bruce Babbit talking along the Potomac) should be self-conscious, but they aren't. And other times the trademark Altmanesque approach to shooting is actually spot-on for a kind of soap opera quality to the proceedings that ends up lending itself to comedy more than the melodramatic moment of revelation. It's a great moment of comedy, for example, not merely in the look between Stringer (Daniel Kincaid) and Joanna Buckley (Wendy Crewson) as he knows it's Dukakis's campaign manager who's been sleeping around with Tanner, and likewise she knows he knows, but how the shot goes, a quick zoom in on each other's eyes, as if the audience didn't know- which of course we do- and the light touch of theme music in the background.<br /><br />Tanner '88 is also great entertainment as far as being able to expect ""For Real"" reality, to quote an episode, as Tanner encounters real politicians, for the most part not knowing that it's a fictional show (Pat Robertson, for example). We know how this will all end, but the question of the how and when is what strikes up drama and madness in equal measure, as if even in the most predictable means it adds to the appeal (new campaign supervisors on how to speak more forcefully and with strict attention, then the scandal(s), awkward campaign stops, a not-quite assassination attempt as one of the funniest asides, dissension from reporters). And touches of irony help along the way, like how Veronica Cartwright's reporter, who at first is not getting much of the scoop, and how she soon acquires the fired former camerman on Tanner's inner circle (let go for an uproariously stupid montage video on drug legalization, taken mostly from Tanner's notebook) who shoots like many a pretentious reality-TV cameraman- and then also reports first on the affair scandal to boot! I also liked how Kitty Dukakis got figured into the actual storyline, as opposed to just another throwaway political figure.<br /><br />And all the while Murphy is a total pro- robbed of an Emmy severely in fact- and there ends up being more for him to do as an actor, in playing a sympathetic but flawed character who as TJ describes about his running for president is like a ""lifestyle choice."" Pamela Reed, Cynthia Nixon and Ilana Levine make up the principle female characters, all with their own pragmatic, optimistic, and just frustrated views on the campaign trail, and they're great to have in the midst of an otherwise predominantly male cast. It's important that they too are right on the ball with Murphy at just saying the right things when diverting from Trudau's script. Suddenly it doesn't feel like we're simply seeing a fictional account of a debate between Tanner, Jesse and Dukakis, but it's more immediate than that. Even more-so than Primary Colors we're given a first-hand look at the process, the ugliness and dirty side, the idiots and mistakes made consistently, the cynicism and irony, and how the media and politics are inseparable and insufferable depending on the beat. And it has the immediacy of news while keeping a hold on the multi-dimensional framework that Altman mastered in his career.<br /><br />Taken as a whole work it is very long, but worth every moment of extra characterization, and ever extra song performance of the theme (my favorite was the hair metal version at the fundraiser in Los Angeles), and it's one of the most insightful, amusing, and superlative works from a quintessential American director.",unsup
11124_0,"Terrific for those looking for a hidden Altman masterwork. It shares many traits with Altman's best (i.e. _Nashville_, _Short Cuts_, and Three Women_, etc.): strong ensemble acting, overlapping dialogue, quirky sense of humor, lots of serendipity. The political insider's perspective - which we must credit to Trudeau - only adds to the fun. _Tanner_ gains greater richness of character and narrative as it unfolds. Here's hoping Tanner runs again",unsup
11125_0,"Two loving parents feed their happy baby on the perch of their country home. It is often said that these early Lumiere shorts are primitive because they have not yet mastered basic film grammar, such as camera movement, editing or the close-up, films like these being a simple, static set-u;, the camera pointing at the scene from a middle distance. But as filmmakers like Godard, Ozu and Kitano, for instance, realised, that very grammar can be a violation of the integrity of the image, forcing us to concentrate of the structure in which the image is only a unit, rather than the image itself.<br /><br />There is nothing primitive or simple about this particular image; as critics have noted, this film offers two levels of movement, one human, recognisable, communal (the family); the other (the trees blowing) part of a different order altogether, of nature, cycles, immemoriality. So while the family represents a similar idea of continuity as the trees, of the species being reproduced, it sis also offered in stark contraast to them, as each member of the trio will eventually die, for all the nourishment and fertility, while nature lives on, indifferent.<br /><br />This frisson of mortality undercuts the film's essential conservatism, and differentiates it from the sinister surveillance of the earlier 'Sortie d'Usine'. This recognition that the powers of the camera-wielding Lumieres are in fact limited, that they are not as omniscient as they once thought they were, is perhaps dramatised in the figure of the father, one of the brothers, one of the first great director-stars, paving the way for Chaplin, Keaton and Welles. His crossing the line from director to star, from passive to active, from subject to object, represents a breach between the observer and observed, a breaking of that invisible line, a destruction of that contract Hollywood will try so desperately to enforce, between reality and fiction. The watcher is now the watched, distinctions and hierarchies have been abolished.<br /><br />Ironically, immortality has been conversely guarenteed - while the man behind the camera is lost, fading into a mere eye, a role taken over by every viewer, the actor brother is trapped forever in this rigid, simple domestic scenario, feeding the ever-hungry, unthinking baby, a harbinger of the medium he invented.",unsup

They explained how a villain's face is drawn with many extreme sharp angles, while the faces of good characters are drawn with much more gentle curves.<br /><br />This explains the downfall of LIFE-SIZE. Jere Burns' face is the living, breathing representation of a Disney bad guy. As Christopher Walken instantly radiates supernatural feakishness, Jere Burns instantly embodies the villainous antagonist. He can't help it. His smile always comes across as sneering and menacing. His look is always fierce.<br /><br />This distraction is very unfortunate as LIFE-SIZE has so much going for it. Tyra Banks is the ultimate doll. Lindsay Lohan's common girl looks helps Tyra Banks' perfect super-model beauty shine. The story is engaging, and the pacing is good.<br /><br />So, why not cast Brian Wimmer as the warm, charming single father? Wimmer's good-guy looks is the Disney artist's dream.

1112_0,"This seemed like a good idea - making a documentary by finding musicians and taping the truth about how they really feel. <br /><br />But who'll care? Which musicians would make an impact regarding the theme of this film? What would strike a chord with folks who really want to know the answers to this question? Well, if you're waiting for an answer - still wait. 1970's 'After School Specials' plus actress Rosanna Arquette has combed New York (mainly) and found 80% of the musicians/singers/songwriters that folks almost have forgotten about and asked them for their thoughts. Musicans...and Yoko Ono.<br /><br />This could have, and would have been interesting if there were a great deal of people we'd be interested in hearing deep inner most thoughts about the industry from from many sides of the spectrum but this was like looking at ""the walking dead"" on celluloid. And the questions, well, I wont be looking for a Rosanna Arquette talk show anytime soon. At least, I pray there wont be any.<br /><br />This is something you can readily expect to see on VH-1 under one of their cheesy shows, but this would be best called: ""Behind the Music with The Cryptkeeper"". This is not to say Rosanna and her crew should have found ONLY young, popular musicians and asked them, they probably wouldn't know how to answer that question at this point in their quest for ""bling"". Which is why at this point it may have been better to go to the near dead to talk about it. Their careers are 'done' and they would have nothing to loose, whereas younger musicians still have commercial appeal and they wouldn't want to eat and spit in the same place.<br /><br />But many of the people in this effort made me cringe... I saw the sickle behind many of them and felt this was their last chance to say something about the industry that they worked in on film before Charon came for them to take them down the river Styx.<br /><br />Of course, I have to have half a brain here and think that those filmed wanted to be filmed and gave permission to be included in this documentary. This could be one of the reasons why we sat through an overblown, overlong episode of ""The Dry and the Dusty"" in the music industry with a few new folks sprinkled in and the few obligatory African Americans for this to look like a diverse event. If Rosanna Arquette didn't have an actress resume and the notorious Toto song ""Rosanna"" behind her, this documentary would have been laughed off the face of this earth by any other filmmaker.<br /><br />Plus, I always cringe when they drag out Yoko Ono to talk about 'music'. I missed ""The Beatles"" years but thanks to other documentaries, films, TV Show appearances, etc., etc., etc., being rammed down your throat about them at every turn, there isn't much one can't know about them. I understand that Ms. Ono is/was an ""artist"" (atrist, a buzz word I will define, in my opinion, as a pretentious faux-intellectual, pacific rim type entities purposely scoping for burnt out/drugged out has-been musicians/producers/songwriters types to feed into an overblown ego when others wont just to finance their visions so they can sit at home and not ever get a real job), and her musings on ""music"" to me are about as helpful as an ant walking on an elephant's back. I'm glad Ms. Arquette, the actress, got to interview her because only an actress can say, ""It is a honor to meet you"" to Yoko Ono. I would suspect to Ms. Arquette it would be 'an honor' for her to meet and talk about music to Mickey Mouse too.<br /><br />Many folks 60 years old and older may want watch this because many of these musicians interviewed are musicians/singers/songwriters that generation grew up with and may want to know how they're doing these days, be surprised they're still alive, may want to know how they felt about working in the industry in their day, and how their kids turned out when they weren't even home to see them grow up. Ms. Arquette gushing over them is always a plus for an ego booster, and we know these folks need an ego booster in their final days.<br /><br />There are a few (a few, mind you) people interviewed by Ms. Arquette that might appeal to those between 35 and 49, but none that would draw in the under 34 crowed unless they were studying music theory and wanted to do an extra credit paper in oldies pop.<br /><br />If you want to see 80% ""The Dry and the Dusty"" in the music industry on the east coast -- and Yoko Ono -- and want to know their thoughts as interviewed by a fading actress (another thinly veiled theme of this documentary to me, really) then this may be the film for you.<br /><br />For others, please don't bother.",unsup

She really does have the potential, she just needs to watch this movie again and take advice from it.

This movie is more than that. The moment I saw the opening scene I realized that I could picture the dialogue being spoken in real life by real adults. It was more honest than most other movies, and it had humor and heart that most movies of this budget and genre don't. Some of the attempts at humor fell flat, but a lot of it was actually...funny.<br /><br />When Eve (Tyra Banks) is turned from a doll to a human being, she thinks she's the best at everything. She is then reminded, however, that the goal is to try your best, not to be the best, and that you can still be a role model and not be perfect. Eve also brings a little wisdom with her when she shows the people around her that life is about happiness and sweetness and simplicity, and that when adults get caught up in petty disagreements and entangled in their ""demanding"" lives, they are only doing it to themselves. Life is too short not to be happy and not to sweat the small stuff and to savor the moment.<br /><br />This is just what I took out of this movie.

I have to admit I am shallow enough to pick it up, just for the nice pic of Miss Banks on the front. <br /><br />Like most reviewers I did not have any high hopes about the acting ability of a former super- model (I did not know, at that time, of her heartbreaking performance in ""Higher Learning"")<br /><br />I was, however, pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Lindsay Lohan and Tyra Banks is there. Tyra Banks has great comical&physical talent. Her lanky legs&arms are totally uncoordinated in the beginning, but the longer the doll is human, the better it gets. Small detail, but her initial clumsiness makes a ""living doll"" even somewhat believable.<br /><br />Miss Lohan is, as usual, very professional and convincing as the shocked girl who got something more than she bargained for. The actor playing her dad? Well. He's somewhat annoying with his constant ""smooth lovable talking"". On the other hand, the ""loving Dad"" is something of a standard mainstay in Disney- movies I guess.... Tyra Banks does an admirable job as Eve, the vapid, ever-beautiful doll-girl-with a heart, and her part has some subtle in-jokes about modeling for the grown-ups(f.i. her obsession with food..)and after the initial annoyance with her overdone stupidity in real-life, she started to warm to me. She's utterly charming in the end. But she cannot sing! Sorry to say but there is one little scene that really made me cringe.<br /><br />One thing is obvious. All actors had a great time filming this little for-TV movie, never mind a cohesive story.<br /><br />Yeah..The Story.. Well.. The script is quite inconsistent here and there. (SPOILER ALERT:How come Eve cannot read a Menu OR a computer screen, yet apparently CAN read ingredients on packages when trying to make a cake..with hilarious results...and THEN again is not able to read ""The Book"" ???) but the flow of the story isn't bad. Even though it seems that the script- writers couldn't really decide were to go: More fairy-tale or more real-life. Magic books?? Come on! This isn't Harry Potter!<br /><br />Little niggles like that do not take away anything from the enjoyment of this rather charming movie though. The target audience(family with kids from 8 to 13)will like it, and it has some nice messages about equality of boys&girls strewn in here and there.<br /><br />All in all it is typical, even ""stereo-typical"" Disney run-of-the-mill produce with some cringe-worthy moments, but for the price, quite enjoyable.

I have to admit I think Vh1 Behind the Music is an excellent production (even seen myself in the background a few times). The difference between the Vh1 show and a documentary like All We are Saying (or babbling it should be). Is that Vh1 does their research and gives you an a full history and true account of the artist (good and bad) from beginning to the present. They make it interesting to the viewer to watch.

She even learns that she can't bring back her Mum, she's gone and she has to live with it and love her Dad with all her might, she still has him and needs to appreciate him more too... But then Eve goes too and both Casey and her Dad are distraught, but they still have each other!<br /><br />This is a beautiful movie in my opinion, especially for little girls, but personally...<br /><br />I can't wait to go and buy this movie in the shops!!!! A must see for any young family or for any young or teen girls! Especially Tyra Banks fans like myself, or Lindsay Lohan fans!<br /><br />Awesome!",unsup
11142_0,"Totally adorable! Lindsay Lohan and supermodel Tyra Banks are charming in this stunning supernatural drama brought to you by the way of Disney! Lohan's character is a young girl who is still stricken by the sudden death of her mother, if though it happened many years ago. She cannot forgive her mum for leaving so soon, and now as her father becomes more and more close to one of his female co-workers, she (Lohan) becomes more and more resentful and starts to exclude herself for the things she normally loves the most.<br /><br />One day, she visits a magic shop and steals a book that promises to hold secrets about bringing back the dead. She takes the book up and performs a ritual from it. Earlier on in the evening, in an attempt to bond with her, her father's girlfriend had presented her with one of the most popular dolls in town, called Eve. The doll's hair accidentally gets mixed up with that of Lohan's character's mum's in a hairbrush and comes to life by way of Tyra Banks when the spell is complete.<br /><br />The film then develops into a slapstick comedy as this fully life sized doll tries to fit in with the real world much to Lohan's shock. The real life doll begins to fall in love with Lohan's dad and they soon realise that if the doll is not returned to it's natural state, she will remain in the real world forever. Tyra/Eve doesn't have a problem with this, until one day on the news, she hears that her brand of Eve dolls is about to be canceled forever. Armed with the wisdom she had acquired from the real world, she returns to dolly-world, leaving a heartbroken Lohan, with whom she has formed a bond, behind.",unsup
11143_0,"A pretty good film, I really loved the cast rather than the scrispt, so I think that it's worth watching, especially when Lindsay Lohan stars in it. My second comment is that I didsn't really enjoy the script. It was quite childish. But, the rest was great.",unsup
11144_0,"Pleasantly surprised by Tyra's bubbly rendition of a doll's outlook and reaction to 'real life'. The situation of child angst and need for her mother can be handled seriously or lightly. Both help get the point across that in tough times, children need love and support. So what if it comes from a doll accidentally brought to life. The movie did not go too overboard on needing to correct the situation as other movies have. The doll's outlook on life based on infusion from commercial ditties and TV perfection helps to show the difference between TV and reality in a way kids can understand. Talk to you kids about this after the movie but enjoy Eve's bubbly attitude and style during the show.",unsup
11145_0,"At first glance I bet 90% of people would under estimate it. But I tell you, this is one heck of a film. It should have been put into theatres because it is SO much fun, and you can watch it with Family, friends, Anyone...and it NEVER gets boring! The comedy is everywhere. Jokes, gags, everything! It is so hilarious and you could seriously laugh through out the whole film. The acting was GREAT! It was clear and good. Finally the PLOT. Truly original! It is simple but the film is truly GREAT! Overall I give it 9/10. A bit of work here and there and the film could actually be PERFECT! RENT the film, actually, BUY the film because whenever your bored or feeling low, this film has enough comedy to make you feel better again. Small Budget, Big Power!",unsup

It's a great family movie and I hope that they decide to release a video of it in stores.",unsup
11147_0,"Naturally, being a warm blooded male, I don't typically seek out movies like this to watch. But often they come on TV and I happen to catch the first few minutes and then get swept up and, on occasion, thoroughly entertained. I'm happy to say this was one of those occasions.<br /><br />Lindsey Lohan had me in tears in The Parent Trap, where she was completely charming and adorable, and she's continues in that vein here. Sadly the actress herself has become rather unappealing as an adult, both appearance and personality wise (just another shallow Hollywood party girl...) but here's a look at how sweet she was before things went wrong. I love freckles! Tyra Banks also stars, which is good because it's great to see an actress who had higher aspirations take roles like this to show they are humble and don't take themselves too seriously. Models (and wrestlers or rappers for men) who think they are serious actors are near the top of my most annoying list!<br /><br />Well, the story of the film is pretty straight forward for a Disneyesque family feature, Casey (Lohan) loses her mother and attempts to resurrect her via voodoo magic, but instead manages to bring her new Eve doll to life, in the form of Tyra Banks. Not exactly a demanding role, but Banks is fun and appealing as the doll come to life trying to fit into the real world. Of course, I'll be a bit cheeky here and say that Type Banks is a perfect choice to play someone who is completely plastic! ;)<br /><br />Anyway, there's not a whole lot of plot to spoil so I'll stop there, just watch this film for the feel good aspect (and young Lohan) and to remember and treasure the innocent (and fun!) years of youth. It's not only teenagers who shouldn't be in a rush to grow up, but adults too!",unsup
11148_0,"Why, because Catholics are taught that the only way to God is through the priest and other Christians are taught that believing in God, his teachings and the teachings of Jesus Christ is what gives you salvation. So I don't have to buy into Jakes' vision of the world and black women in particular. I gave this movie a 4/10 only because I loved to see black actors working I only wish they could find some other films to exhibits their crafts. I know that life is not a basket of roses but I believe that man is basically good that he makes a lot of wrong choices but give a break every wrong choice in one movie! 25% of the black men were good, again dope and weakness is all we ever see of ourselves and oh yes beauty shops.

They all appear to be coherent...as in Sex...Sobriety...and Rock & Roll.<br /><br />The majority of the artists have been well known for over thirty years...and some of them almost did not make it this far.

11150_0,"I ordered this on OnDemand a few weeks ago and I wasn't at all impressed with the film.<br /><br />I was, however, impressed with Kimberly Elise's and Loretta Devine's performances. Those two women alone carry this mess of a film.<br /><br />The film is filled with clichés. And the way the story is presented is sort of mismatched and should've been shown in the proper order, from front to back, not from back to front (with the ending being first.) The film could've been a really great one if somebody touched up the screenplay and got a better director.<br /><br />With that all being said, the film has a powerful opening and two powerful performances from Kimberly Elise and Loretta Devine.<br /><br />It's sad how two actresses (both of whom are personal favorites of mine) are reduced to getting scraps like this for films.<br /><br />Their immense talent is wasted on awful, forgettable movies such as this when it should be used in good quality films that zip them off to the Oscars.<br /><br />It's sad that Hollywood has this bunch of actresses that they have no idea what to do with so the real talent is left to getting D-grade fair such as this.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that it's a black or white thing as far as actors/actresses getting good roles but Hollywood sure has a lot of underused talent with black actors. The mentioned Loretta Devine and Kimberly Elise come to mind, as well as Whoopi Goldberg. After The Color Purple all she got was those pathetic comedies (with only sister Act and Ghost rising to the occasion.) <br /><br />With that being said there are just as many white actors as there are black actors that Hollywood has no idea what to do with so I don't think it's a matter of Hollywood being racist anymore, just being stupid.",unsup
11151_0,"In this film, T.D. Jakes cites the statistic that a woman is ""killed by a man who says he loves her"" every 15 seconds. This is inaccurate. The statistic that he should have cited is that a woman is ""battered"" every 15 seconds. This was a major motion picture (and an enjoyable one at that)and so it is hard to believe facts like that were not vetted. If they were vetted, this would seem to be an intentional distortion.<br /><br />The movie was impressively shot and presented, and I came away at least impressed with Jakes' acting ability (though perhaps that sort of ability is requisite for his line of work). This statistic misrepresentation, however, raises questions about Jakes' reliability.",unsup

The ugly reality of life came to surface in this film. Typically black men in the ghetto don't show much respect toward women, abuse them on a regular basis for their selfish, immoral and degraded sexual perversions, as hinted, behind closed doors. I felt both surprised and disturbed by the portrayal of the conscienceless, shifty, two-faced and shameless men who very well painted the picture of life and the kind of men one would meet in the hellish world of drug abuse, prostitution, and poverty.

11154_0,"I had a chance to see a screening of the movie in Atlanta. It was a very powerful piece. Although it definitely has a religious theme, it is rooted in secular life. . The film does not sugarcoat the issues that the characters go through, but it depicts the issues in a tasteful,non-vulgar way that really hits home. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. There were even some counselors on hand to help people deal with the personal impact of the film. Kimberly Elise was outstanding. She is definitely a star on the rise... . I think has the potential be the modern-age version of The Passion of The Christ.",unsup
11155_0,"I have only just seen this movie and it really touched my heart because some of the things that Michelle went through I went through. The only difference was that her step-father was my step-mother and her mother was my father and the sexually abuse was physical and emotional abuse.(I didn't end up in prison though). Some parents, for some strange reason, think that their happiness comes before their children. I don't understand that. I think that a parent must always believe their child until they find out they are lying, not the other way around. When you have a child you pledge your life to providing for and being there for that child no matter what. There should be no compromise because that child is in the world because of your choice. I think that this movie gives hope to those who feel like they have none. It gave me some hope that my life doesn't have to be the endless black hole that my stepmother wanted it to be.",unsup
11156_0,"Renowned minister and author Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter's House of Dallas, Texas has brought to screen his best-selling novel that has been a major hit amongst women in his ministry for nearly 10 years. Written at a time in his life when he doubted if he could (read: should) be the 'voice' of the forgotten women, the broken woman, the fallen woman, ...the woman that is often invisible in most church congregations, after the release of his novel, the overwhelming answer was 'preach on, T.D., preach on'. And preach he did, to thousands in his Woman Thou Art Loosed conventions all across the country to sold out stadiums. It's not really a surprise when one knows the history of the journey that this project would be his first feature film effort. Some might argue that this is his most anointed work, especially given the numbers that most lower income minority households now are single parent households and that translates more than likely to often being led by mothers. What happens when these 'mothers' fall into hopeless situations that seem outside the confines of the normal assistance that most churches are only equip to handle? It's in that chasm that Bishop Jakes found his voice.., and calling. <br /><br />Woman Thou Art Loosed, the movie, is an ambitious project. Well written, and acted by a stellar cast (more on that later), it only suffers from a few minor problems that are mostly cinematic issues. The lighting throughout the movie was uneven and could have benefited from an overall continuity of theme, but all in all, this problem is minor in contrast to the action and dialogue on the screen. The outstanding casting of Kimberly Elise as the troubled lead, Michelle Jordan, who opens this movie, pistol in hand, in the midst of an altar call at a revival meeting of Bishop Jakes, is both tragic and heroic as you learn of her desperation to make sense of her life's choices and conflicts. Kimberly brings a new definition to pathos, and in several scenes proves that she's an actress of great skill and technique, while never allowing the mechanics to be noticed. Adept at emoting with just a look or turn of her brow, she breathes life into Michele's often difficult and challenging scenes with the ease of someone who's really been 'there' in the depths of despair. At it's core, WTAL is a love story. Love gone bad, love gone wrong, love unrequited and love never fully developed. Michelle wants her mother, Cassie, to love her, to see her and acknowledge her. Formidable actress Loretta Devine, portrays a mother that needed mothering, and unfortunately can't give to her daughter what she's never experienced. Failing her daughter at a most critical moment in their journey, creates the rift between mother and daughter and sets into motion that incredible opening scene. Pay close attention to the scenes that include these two actresses, together, for a master's class in scene study.<br /><br />But make no mistake, the heartbeat of this film is Bishop Jakes and his sermons. Whether being delivered in the pulpit or in a prison cell, his message of restoration is ever present. The moments that soar in this film are those that center on his fiery, common-sense sermons and his ability to touch the very core of issues in simple and succinct analogies. Much more could have been made of these moments and I think the direction in the services suffered a bit, but then again, how do you really direct the holy spirit? Director Michael Schultz is legendary and yet this might be the problem: his style is a little dated and isn't as edgy as some of the more modern films of our times. That being said, I did appreciate his use of the close-up that allowed us to 'see' every nuance of emotion.<br /><br />It might prove a little difficult to find this film, but it's worth a diligent search. If for no other reason, for the sheer inspiration of the story and to observe major talent acting for once in material that they obviously believe in. I sensed that many of those tears that were shed, weren't all about the characters they were inhabiting. More than a few actors were most likely 'loosed' in the process, as well. It's that powerful of a movie. Highly recommended.",unsup
11157_0,"When my girlfriend dragged me to this movie, I went with her to treat her to part of her Birthday present; but secretly, I was dreading to see this movie. I thought that here's another ""Christian"" made production, many of which seem to suffer from lack luster acting and weak direction.<br /><br />None of those elements exist in this riveting drama based on the composite experiences of various women encountered by TD Jakes through out his ministry. From the stunning beginning of the movie to its hopeful and heart warming end, I was enthralled by the very realistic characters(especially the main character), their various struggles, and their varying Faith, or lack there of, in God. <br /><br />This movie does not milk-toast the church or sugar coat those who are True Believers, but shows us for what we truly are; real sinners saved continually by real Amazing GRACE and the Great Mercy of God.<br /><br />For those who think you have to be lilly white to be accepted by God, I highly recommend this movie as a big dose of reality. But for those who just see the church as full of hypocrites, you'll come away with an appreciation for how much God loves us imperfect beings and why the Church is full of us!",unsup

Ultimately it allows us to share the experiences of a some great artists in their search for true expression, which is really a universal human need and it certainly evoked some empathy in this writer. Of significance is the clear communication that dedication to their art form, the performance and sharing of their music is much more important to them than the money they earn.",unsup

Don't get me wrong, I liked the film, I just couldn't connect emotionally with events on the screen.<br /><br />That said this is very good movie. The acting is excellent.

To make it worse, every point made on the screen is hammered home immediately afterward by having a character tell us what we just saw. The acting is nearly as bad as the screenplay. How is 104 minutes of unlikeable characters whining, crying, and refusing to act with any intelligence supposed to entertain or enlighten us? <br /><br /> I thought they didn't make them like this any more; unfortunately, sometimes they still do.

It had moments of intense humor, and moments of deep sadness. The emotional roller-coaster this movie put me on was one very few films can achieve, let alone sustain throughout the length of the movie. ""The Road Home"" is a movie that should be seen by masses. It is an exceptional film, one that deserves to be shown to the public at large. Drew Johnson has the markings of a major-league film-maker and with this movie he hits one out of the park!",unsup

It was great to see so many talented artist (going back to the 60s) all say the same thing, that the music business is a difficult, but a rewarding experience. The only thing that bothered me was that Steven Tyler was a stand out bitter bitch. He had the opportunity to point out how lucky he was, being dropped in the early 80s, and now enjoying a hugely successful career more than 20 years later. Instead he bitched about downloads, and his former manager getting 20%. Wow, sad comments from a guy who owes his sobriety, and second career in the music business to that guy. Having been in the music business, It is great to here so many musicians give songwriting credit to an unexplained force.

Assuming this is true, he should know better than this. I understand this is a chick-flick but to appeal to the male audience there needs to be some accuracy here. This movie is definitely not BULL DURHAM. PITCHER AND THE PINUP falls flat. Everything with baseball in this movie made me laugh. The sports clichés, stadium inaccuracies, and actors who don't look like ball-players make thishilarious. Among the the absurd highlights: -- ""But coach, (I can't play third) I've pitched EVERY GAME this year!"" -- The gypsy/scout who foretells the future with his deck of cards. -- The can't miss Major Leaguer who can't hit balls thrown at a speed meant for a 4-yr-old with a giant plastic red bat until he learns a poem to help him with his hitting. -- The star going AWOL for two weeks and being allowed back by a sympathetic manager because of a ""woman."" -- The best friend being offered a contract and a spot on the team after the manager sees him playing catch. No hitting, No workout, No interview. Just catch. -- ""Congratulations on your 15 strikeouts and your 4 for 4 with a home run."" <br /><br />Basically, this movie is absurd, yet hilarious. You will only like this movie of you are female. If you are a real guy you will fine this funny.<br /><br />My other gripes: -- Borrowed love story of Forrest Gump -- Why in the world was she always saying ""I love this country?"" Was she an immigrant? I guess so because she grew up in Vegas. -- Flashback overload. Enough of the Star Wars and Farrah Fawcett Tshirts. Also, if you use historical events to timeframe, use something astronomical, not the obscure highjacking of a cruise ship. My favorite timeframe placing was when one character goes, ""Man, it is 1988!"" <br /><br />In the end, this movie HILARIOUS. Cheesy lines, bad casting, horrible acting, and inaccuracies ...

""The Widow of St. Pierre"" is a beautful and haunting film that tells the story of a man committed to death on a small French fishing island that does not have a guillotine and how he learns to repent his crime and becomes a useful member of the community. the judge obsevers, ""We committed a murderous brute and we're going to top a benefactor."" There is another story of the marriage of Le Capitaine (Daniel Auteuil) and his wife Madam La (Juliette Binoche). Of their love and understanding for each other. The play between these two actors is something to see, they just look at each other and you can see their feelings for one another. She feels for the prisoner and her husband sympathizes with her feelings and understands her. The director Patrice Leconte has done an admirable job portraying the time, place and atmosphere. Emir Kusturica who plays Neel, the murderer, Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil all play their parts with a quiet understanding for their characters.

All this is mixed in a tale that, despite of its slow pace, makes you want remain in your chair desiring for a happy final that you know has no place in the story.

11188_0,"BEWARE OF SPOILERS!<br /><br />In this French language film (with English subtitles), Juliette Binoche plays what some today might call a ""bleeding heart liberal,"" maybe even a head-strong bleeding heart liberal. Her name is Pauline and her husband Jean (Daniel Auteuil) is the Captain of a troop of soldiers on the island of St. Pierre off the coast of Newfoundland. The year is 1849. <br /><br />One night two of the local peasants get drunk and have an argument about whether a certain man of the island is fat or just big. As a joke they go to his cottage and rouse him from his dinner table with calls of ""fat!"" and ""big"" until comes out to investigate with a knife in his hands for protection. In the ensuing confrontation one of the men holds the big guy from behind while the other (Ariel Neel Auguste, played by Emir Kusturica) knocks the knife from his hand, picks it up, and in a kind of madness cuts the man open to see--as they later testify at the trial--whether he is really fat or just big.<br /><br />As it happens, Neel is condemned to death, but can't be executed because the law requires that he be beheaded and there is no guillotine on the island, nor is there an executioner. Since he can hardly run away from this snowy island, Pauline wants him out of his cell and at work helping her around the house, maybe as a gardener. Jean, who loves Pauline extravagantly, agrees and Neel becomes Pauline's protégé. She wants to reform him and teach him to read, etc. The tension in the film builds as her good intentions run afoul of the island's governing authorities. Through it all Jean stands steadfast by his wife in a most heroic way.<br /><br />I won't say anymore about the plot. What interests me more is the motivation of Pauline in helping Neel. Is she motivated by generosity of heart or by her desire to be a person doing good? This is an ancient question. Do we do good because that is our nature or because we are fulfilling a desire to be good? Furthermore, is Pauline's heart filled with human love for Neel or does she in fact have a yen for him?<br /><br />Director Patrice Leconte gives us plenty of reason to be skeptical. When Pauline is sitting practically on Neel's lap while teaching him to read, the camera closes in on their fingers as they trace the lines in the text. The fingers get closer and closer together until they touch and even mingle a bit.<br /><br />Cut immediately to a scene through a bedroom door: two naked figures in vigorous sexual union. At first we can't see who they are, and it is hard not to imagine that it is Pauline and Neel in adulterous embrace. However, it is Pauline and her husband, Jean. <br /><br />In another scene the bored women of the island are seen talking about how close Pauline and Neel have gotten and how this must inspire Jean to be a better lover; but in fact we can see that what the presence of Neel is doing is lighting a fire under Pauline.<br /><br />Captain Jean is an entirely admirable character who loves his wife. Neel is also admirable in that he loves Pauline but doesn't make any moves on her. He becomes something of a hero when he saves the building of a café on wheels being moved from crashing. She is of course the most talked-about person on the island, the source of most of the gossip. As we watch the film unfold there is a sense of doom coming. We know something terrible is going to happen; we just don't know what or to whom.<br /><br />In the final analysis I guess we can say that Pauline--who, in the framing device, narrates the events from memory--got not what she deservedfor no one deserves what happened to her; nor can we attribute what happens to some kind of fatalism. Instead the tragedy can be seen as the direct result of her compromised behavior. Or perhaps we can make a more generous interpretation and say that no good deed ever goes unpunished.<br /><br />This film can also be seen as a tract against capital punishment since Neel is basically a good man who made a bad mistake. He is clearly a worthwhile member of the community. He is also repentant even to the point of believing that he must pay for his sin in accordance with the law. <br /><br />See this for director Patrice Laconte who has a nice touch with historical period pieces and directs with the kind of attention to detail and story that rank him among the very best auteurs of the French cinema. I also highly recommend his Ridicule (1996) and La fille sur la pont (1999).",unsup
11189_0,"If Thirteen Days' is a picture that President Bush, USofA, praises as an example of good warring and political enterprise, and Traffic' is a film that the rest of us think can help resolve an American drug addition problem, then The Widow of St. Pierre' must certainly be the film that toys with issues of capital punishment, human rights, and the prison system in general.<br /><br />There was a line in the script, spoken by Le Capitaine at a point when his fate is pretty much sealed as he takes a moral and compassionate stand in a challenge to those that govern this French island. That line stands out in my mind and goes something like this: ""The person we send to prison is never the person that we execute.""<br /><br />The point therein is a pestering contemporary topic and social dilemma of this wonderfully written and directed film: should prisons be a tool towards rehabilitation as a primary task, with punishment as something much lower on the list of bureaucratic to-do's? Or is it the opposite or something in between that gets adjusted at whim in an attempt to be politically polite to those in power who can demonstrate being 'hard on crime'?<br /><br />Those are the thoughts that I took with me after today's morning screening (actually across the street from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills which I think appropriate!!)",unsup

More than anything it gave me hope that some artists of the past/present are still trying to make contact and teach those of the present into the future because they care about where the quality of music goes. It's TRUE!! Image is starting to be everything when it comes to the music! What happened to the art of expressing it regardless of whether your nose is crooked, teeth crooked, whatever!

11190_0,"I've watched this movie 4 times. What so unusual about that is, that I am for capital punishment. Based on actual events, this movie recounts the transformation of a man sentenced to death by guillotine or in French slang ""widow"". While he awaits to be executed, he performs ""community service"" for an army captain's wife.<br /><br />There are two love stories I found in this movie. The most obvious one, the captain and his wife. He has so much faith and trust in her, that even as people rumour about his wife, he defends her to the bitter end. The other love story is that of human kind. Madame La, is fully aware of the horrible act the prisoner has committed, but she has enough guts and gumption to prove that behaviors can ""change"".<br /><br />This movie leans towards anti-capital punishment but it does not preach that at all. Madame La, like Dead Man Walking's Sister Helen Prejan, is capable of seeing through even the worst evil, and finding compassionate remorse in their fellow human beings. I don't necessarily agree with them but I must admire them for they truly understand the best and worst of human nature. Maybe that's why I watched it so many times.",unsup

The ""problem"" is St. Pierre is a gentle community and has no executioners that not even any of their sailors would bring any to the island. No executioner, no head. <br /><br />Madame La (Juliette Binoche) is such a gentle soul living there who believes the man is good and useful to the community but also hidden under the surface is innocently sexually obsessed with the man before she even really meets him which is what much of the community thinks she is leaning toward, especially some bored debutantes which are like counterparts to Juliette's character. Her husband is the warden of the penitentiary (Daniel Auteuil) under Paris headquarters but technically has jurisdiction because they are not in Paris so he allows the condemned to be at his wife's disposal because he supports her and they love each other, which is seen as signs of weakness by the ferocious Paris French Republic putting pressure on the local Republic making such questions arise: do humans make the law or does the law make us? Surely nobody in St. Pierre not having endured the repression of France needs to make examples by collecting heads except for the cowardly governor and admirals who are paid to appear strong.

That is, once a person is sentenced, by the time they are put to death a lot of time has passed and they may not be the same person--and may no longer deserve to die. In the case of the film, the delay was BRIEF compared to our modern penal system, as the delay looked to be about two years. During this interim time, the convicted man did so much to help those around him that there was little will, except among some idiots in the local government, to execute him. The film is very interesting and gives us insight into life on the isolated island of St. Pierre (a French possession near New Foundland) and because the story, it seems, is based on a true story!

He has a difficult role in this film that requires a kind of underplaying and a certain stiffness in his performance.

This is a very good film, where a convict becomes a kind of protegé of the captain of the French island. The convict notices the admiration of Captain's wife and the captain also noticed it, but left the things going as they were. A guillotine has to be brought to the island to kill the convict, but it was hardly difficult to find out a person able to manipulate the guillotine. Finally the captain, under the strong influence of his wife, decided not to allow this 'crime', he was arrested and later judged and killed. The convict was also killed.

Now that I've seen her on screen, I think she comes across as a cross between Marlene Dietrich and Charo - a surprisingly fun mix.

Juliette Binoche portrays Pauline, the sympathetic wife of the local garrison commander on a bleak French Island off Newfoundland. A man who has brutally killed another is sentenced to death, but the village must await the arrival of a guillotine and executioner. Those are the rules. As Pauline takes the cause of the murderer, Neel(Emir Kusturica), as her own, he wins the affection of the small, insular community with his good works. But the hide-bound, dour council members of the village insist they must carry out their duty. Pauline's husband, Jean (Daniel Auteuil) supports her every device to seek Neel's freedom. The sexual tension among the three is palpable; the danger that the fundamentalist Pauline poses to her husband sits on the film like an enveloping cloud seeking to blur this lucid discussion of the difficulties posed by capital punishment cases even where the prisoner is clearly guilty of a brutal crime. All of the acting performances are sterling, well contained and bearing the weight of the fatalistic outcome.

DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM.)<br /><br /> Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche turn in fine performances in this killer-with-a-heart-of-gold melodrama. But the plot is unrealistic.<br /><br /> Auguste Neel was in fact guillotined in Saint-Pierre in the nineteenth century after waiting months for the means of execution to arrive from Martinique. You can see the guillotine in Saint-Pierre's modern and beautifully designed museum. (Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, a French territory hard by the coast of southern Newfoundland, is an absorbing place to visit; I was there in 1999.)<br /><br /> In the movie, Neel wanders around the island after receiving his death sentence for murder, performing one good deed after another -- some heroic, others mundane, but all saintly. Was the French penal system really so inflexible that no one would commute his sentence despite all his good works, including saving another's life? That's the way it's portrayed.<br /><br /> Neel would have been even more saintly to take the islanders up on one of the many chances they gave him to escape to ""les Anglais"" (i.e., Newfoundland, 10 miles away across a channel). In the end, his self-imposed martyrdom proves foolish, for it leads not only to his own execution, but to that of Daniel Auteuil's character as well.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, the film is beautifully photographed and the acting is fine.

11202_0,"I loved this movie! It moved me, made me laugh and cry and appreciate love, hate, and compassion. Juliette Binoche is the narrator of this story, she is the one who presents the events from her perspective, but incorporates other into it. This movie has wonderful symbolism that is expressed in so many ways. Whether it is a horse, a ship, or people marching, the different expression of movement and the implication of each and everyone of those is vividly portrayed. Also Binoche's view and adoration of her husband and her compassion to the prisoner is so real, so touching. At times, the viewer along with the narrator seems uncertain of feelings expressed toward Jean and Neel and the camera plays with the viewer's mind allowing him to suspect the worst and be pleasantly surprised. This movie has a very gloomy setting, but really the feelings expressed, the magnitude of love is so powerful that the dull surroundings do not strain the viewer. I thought this movie was phenomenal because it expressed the best of human nature in such real ways. It showed that not everything is black and white, not everyone is jealous and vengeful and finally people do have a sense of obligation and honor.

The New Wave fizzled out after producing little of value, and the 1950s (no doubt its faults were real enough; Truffaut probably came close to seeing every single French film of that decade, so in one respect he'd be in a position to know) is looking more and more like a golden age, so maybe the phrase ""cinema de qualite"" is about due to be reclaimed. ""Quality cinema"", without the sarcastic sneer.<br /><br />There are many lush camera pans over bleakly attractive scenery, which is good (not bad) in itself; but the main point is, Leconte USES the scenery. We don't doubt for a minute that this is the farthest-flung province in the entire French empire. The sea is rough (which partly explains why the murderer rows back to face execution: when every oar stroke is an effort, AND it looks to him as though he's doing the cowardly thing, the effort becomes unbearable). Every section of the island not actively occupied by civilisation feels as though it doesn't belong to civilisation - even though it's so desolate it doesn't belong to anything else, either. In short: the story clearly belongs here, and nowhere else.<br /><br />One of the great things about this film is the way it shows people acting (in a plausible way) on desires which it's easy to overlook or underestimate the force of. The husband trusts his wife's moral judgment, and is prepared to act on it. The murderer feels as though he's living under a just sentence of death and does what he can to redeem himself. The islanders are all pragmatists: at the start they believe in the value of retributive justice, but as the sheer uselessness of retributive justice becomes more obvious with each passing day, for MONTHS, the belief collapses under the strain of holding on to it. It's partly due to Leconte's skilled use of location that we're aware of the effect the mere passage of time has on people. One of the best films of 2000, if you ask me.",unsup

On this small island, Ariel Neel Auguste (Emir Kusturica) awaits Madame La Guillotine for having killed a man in a drunken brawl. A burly brute of a man, Ariel's quick thinking saves an islander from certain death when a house being moved slides down a hill.<br /><br />Ariel's charm wins him the regard of Madame Pauline La (Juliette Binoche), wife of Captain Jean (Daniel Auteuil), the commander of the island's garrison. Islanders are divided on the issue of execution; most would like to save Ariel. Madame La sends Ariel, now a trusted prisoner, on a mission in a small dinghy. The idea is that Ariel will escape into nearby British or American territory, but Ariel true to his parole faithfully returns and even helps bring Madame La Guillotine ashore.<br /><br />Yugoslavian born Emir Kusturica plays the French islander the commoner Ariel Neel Auguste with a sensitive gentility, persuasively tough and docile, hardheaded and obedient.<br /><br />As Ariel waits execution, tables turn on Captain Jean. He's ordered home to Metroplitain France. Officially he's a guest of the fleet Admiral. Actually with political unrest at home Captain Jean faces the firing squad. He too is told of the many opportunities to escape, but steadfastly follows orders right up to his execution by firing squad.<br /><br />Daniel Auteuil plays the tough-fisted French Captain with the practised arrogance of an officer used to getting his way.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure a motion picture though full of violence or threats of violence would be fully understood by an American audience. The parallelism between Captain Jean and the commoner Ariel is far too delicate for audiences which are addicted to shoot-em up high speed police chase lines.",unsup

Nell, who stabbed the victim, is sentenced to die with his head severed in the guillotine while Louis is sentenced to hard labor. During the transportation to the prison under the custody of Captain Jean (Daniel Auteuil), there is an accident and Louis dies. While spending his days in the cell waiting for the guillotine and the executioner, Neel is invited by the captain's wife Mrs. Pauline (Juliette Binoche) to help her in her garden and becomes her protégé. Later he has a process of rehabilitation helping the locals in minor works and becomes very popular in the island. When he saves the building Café du Nord and her owner from sinking in the sea, his popularity increases and nobody but the governor and politicians of the council wants his death. Neel marries Eleontine Jeanne-Marie, but sooner he is informed that the ship Marie Galante has just left Martinique bringing a guillotine. Now the Governor and politicians need to find an executioner in the population to execute the sentence.<br /><br />""La Veuve de Saint-Pierre"" is a beautiful dramatization of a story of rehabilitation and intolerance. I do not know whether this event is partially true or not  there are references in Internet to this story but in sites that I can not trust  but this movie is wonderful. The story and screenplay are engaging and very well written with powerful lines; the direction of Patrice Leconte and the performances are top- notch, with Juliette Binoche extremely beautiful and elegant as usual and showing a magnificent chemistry with Daniel Auteuil; the cinematography and costumes are wonderful.

11207_0,"I have always been a Patrice Leconte devotee. His career in which incoherence and eclecticism get on well together (perhaps that's why he's often slated by French critics) is one of the most fruitful you could dream of, even if French mainstream public often associates his name with ""les Bronzés"" (1978), a commercial hit which put him on the map as well as the actors, the famous troupe of the Splendid and tends to overshadow the rest of his prolific career which spawned treasures like ""Tandem"" (1987), ""Monsieur Hire"" (1989) or ""Le Mari De la Coiffeuse"" (1990).<br /><br />This vehicle ""La Veuve De Saint Pierre"" (2000) was originally to be directed by another veteran of French cinema Alain Corneau (who sadly shot the insipid ""Prince Du Pacifique"" that year, perhaps the nadir of his career) but he turned down the role due to disputes with the producers. So, Patrice Leconte inherited the project. His choice was motivated by the desire to work with one of the two main roles, Juliette Binoche (he had teamed up with Daniel Auteuil the previous year for ""La Fille Sur Le Pont, 1999)<br /><br />The title of the film has a double meaning: the ""veuve"" refers to Binoche after her husband's demise. The opening sequence presents her to us in her mourning garb (Leconte's work is served by lavish costumes). The audience knows that she is the ""veuve"" and will discover in the long flashback, how she has lost her husband. But a ""veuve"" is also a slang word for the sinister guillotine and it has a tongue-in-cheek connotation: Saint Pierre unlike France hasn't got a death instrument and must have one. All the time, the island is deprived of a guillotine, it remains a ""veuve"".<br /><br />There are clearly two sides. On the one hand, the officers' who govern the island and are die-hards of the death sentence and on the other hand, the private triangle which encompasses Auteuil, Binoche and Kusturica. Between the two poles, the impending threat of the execution with the recurring images of the ship sailing across the Atlantic with on board the guillotine. The scenario eschews the tempting trap of the Manicheism and the officers aren't caricatures. As a matter of fact, one of the main thrusts of the film is to deride the leaders of the island who seek at all costs to keep the death sentence and their obstinacy is made ludicrous by the postpone of the sentence and the last words of the voice over contain grim details which give a slap to one of Doctor Guillotin's famous words: ""a painless death is a progress for humanity"". Moreover, they prove to be unscrupulous because when a new inhabitant settles on the island, they entrust him the role of the executioner without taking care of his opinion.<br /><br />In the private triangle, madame La by guiding Neel on the way of redemption is full of condescension and solicitude but she's a complex character. Her reasons and motivations to redeem Neel are rather elusive even if she says (I don't remember the accurate cue): ""I think human soul is unpredictable and can be able to become conscientious and intelligent. A little gratifying cue which should have been more construed and fleshed out and remains an inkling. Then, why would she encourage the sacrifice of such a devoted husband to try to save a convicted killer whereas it's doomed to failure? Is it a response to her husband's love? (If Auteuil sacrifices himself it's for love for his wife and respect for Neel). Certainly and if so, Leconte's piece of work is a novel and quirky approach on the relationship between husband and wife, a quite notable feat for an author who has seldom studied this topic in his filmography, except maybe in ""Le Mari De La Coiffeuse"".<br /><br />Buoyed by a more than palatable cast with a special mention to Emir Kusturica who was a discerning choice because he could convey vulnerability and fragility to his persona of great strapping man, ""La Veuve De Saint Pierre"" may be derivative if we consider the theme of redemption and the thrust quoted in the fourth paragraph but its treatment is a far cry from Hollywood's formulaic conventions. How to rank it in Leconte's uneven but usually riveting filmography? It isn't on a par with his towering achievements but stands out as a more than palatable flick which however could have gained by being more deepened.",unsup

""Widow..."" is more about integrity, honor, love, and other intangibles than it is about its relatively simple storyline and the characters involved. A beautifully crafted somber film, ""Widow..."" is recommended for mature audiences because a measure of maturation is required to appreciate all this austere film has to offer.",unsup
11209_0,"THE WIDOW OF ST.-PIERRE may not be a great film, but amidst a crop of mediocre current releases, it's a fine effort that boasts a hardworking cast, awesome costumes and sets, terrific cinematography and excellent direction. For those unlikely to stay in and read MOBY DICK, the combination of austere location, mid-19th-century maritime theme, and the Reaper looming o'er the ocean tides offers a satisfying divertissement on a cloudy Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Based on actual court records, the plot begins after a Parisian military captain, Jean (Daniel Auteuil), and his new wife, Madame La (Juliette Binoche), arrive on an isolated French isle off the coast of Newfoundland, where widows outnumber balmy days 50 to 1. One night, two blind-drunk men brutally knife a man to find out if he's `fat or just big.' The court sentences instigator Neel Auguste (Yugoslav director Emir Kusturica) to death by guillotine, `the widow,' in French parlance. But the remote fishing island does not possess the instrument of destruction that its French rulers dictate and must obtain a loaner from Martinique. While awaiting its arrival, the government locks Neel in a dark cell and entrusts him to the care of the Captain and Madame La.<br /><br />An MSW waiting to happen, Madame has a weakness for `desperate cases.' She asks Neel to build her a greenhouse and tend her plants, a challenging request in this hardscrabble environment. As the Parisian belle negotiates her homesickness and the austerity of her surroundings by cultivating her garden, Neel confronts his own banishment from society and cultivates his compassion. This is one of several lovely parallelisms director Patrice Leconte teases out.<br /><br />The sexual tension between Madame and Neel, though enacted subtly, is nevertheless palpable. During a reading lesson, their fingers brush while scanning a page. As Neel scarfs down her soup in a mildly bestial manner, she looks on lovingly. And when he asks her why she so nurtures him, she replies, `We change, whatever we do. I am sure of that.'<br /><br />Meanwhile, the fisherfolks' tongues are wagging-ever cautioning Madame's loving husband about the duo's blossoming relationship. The Captain, however, venerates his wife's `humanism' and trusts her enough not to interfere. He is another wonderful character, both strong and sensitive, passionate in his love of his wife, unwilling to back down in his defense of their collective ideals.<br /><br />Both Binoche and Kusturica prove more than equal to their roles. Binoche imbues her character with much more depth than that of Vianne in CHOCOLAT. With her limpid brown eyes and achingly empathic face, she elevates this personage to the level of classic tragic heroine. Kusturica, given a part that begs overacting, never wrings out our emotions, yet shows he possesses true remorse for his actions and a heart kinder still than that of his benefactors.<br /><br />Most memorable is the set. Shot in Nova Scotia and Quebec, the film uses clapboard and stone buildings, often snow-salted, as an apt metaphor for the government's rigidity in refusing to commute Neel's sentence, despite his overwhelming popularity in the village as a doer of good deeds. Clearly the film excoriates capital punishment, with such dialogue as Madame's fervent cry, `They aren't punishing the same man they sentenced!'<br /><br />This widow's walk proceeds at a leisurely pace, perhaps a mite too slowly for 21st-century attention spans. But overall, if you like a good, dark tragedy, pick a dreary night and go.<br /><br />",unsup

Both men are apprehended and condemned to die as punishment for their actions. The way to die is beheading by guillotine, or ""the widow"" in the vernacular.<br /><br />Thus begins this story that director Patrice Leconte directed, based on the screen play by Claude Faraldo. The story is set in the remote island of Saint Pierre, off the coast of Newfoundland. This is a hostile environment settled by the French. Saint Pierre boasts a lot of widows who have survived the rigors of the climate and the hard lives their husbands led.<br /><br />Into this milieu we find a military captain and his wife. Both are Parisians and appear to be compassionate, at heart. When Neel, the surviving drunk is brought to be kept in a cell within the military quarters of the island, the wife, Madame La, takes an interest in the man. With her husband's consent, she asks for his help in tending a green house in the premises and other errands.<br /><br />Neel and Madame La are at simple view, just opposites. The kindness Neel sees in her, transforms him. Madame La even goes to help him learn to read. All these actions don't sit well with the rest of the inhabitants and the people in the government who demand a guillotine is sent over and have him execute the prisoner.<br /><br />The film works because the brilliant performance of Juliette Binoche, who as Madame La, makes her mark in the picture. Her compassion for Neel is genuine; in her heart she believes this man, a product of the environment in which he was born, shows qualities that no one has seen in him.<br /><br />Emir Kusturica, a noted film director himself, is also one of the assets of the movie. Mr. Kusturica is a large man with unkempt looks, who is totally believable as Neel. His interaction with Madame La turns from gratitude into a noble love that is not meant to be.<br /><br />The other principal is Daniel Auteuil who is perfect as the captain, the husband of Madame La, who is outraged by what he perceives to be the wrong punishment for the accused Neel. In spite of the menacing presence of Neel next to his wife, he trusts her as he knows her kind heart belongs to him only.<br /><br />""La veuve de Saint Pierre"" is a great movie that will satisfy viewers in search of a different story.

11213_0,"First the plot: A policeman investigates a mysterious set of serial killings in which the bodies are attacked, moved a considerable distance and systematically dissected in less than a minute. His attention is caught by an attractive blonde (Maryam d'Abo) who turns up at various murder scenes. Things get weird when he attempts to question her, for she runs, and when he pursues her, she is remarkably athletic, and, she shoots at him with a ray gun.<br /><br />It turns out that the killer is a shape shifting alien criminal with psychic powers, and that she (the blonde) is sole survivor (the medical officer) of the prison ship from which it has escaped, and which is now crippled and in orbit around the Earth. She has come hunting it because it will wipe out the human race.<br /><br />This has every cliché ever to appear in any science fiction movie: glimpses of a scaly monster lurking in the dark, ray guns, space ships, zombies and gob-smacked humans standing comically in front of alien shuttles going ""I don't believe it"". Furthermore, it is guilty of that old filmmakers' favourite, the vacuum of space which transmits sound and in which fires burn freely. This is really B grade stuff. But I think it is a good movie. So why do I like it so much?<br /><br />I like it principally because of Ta'ra (d'Abo's character). This is partly because Maryam d'Abo is absolutely gorgeous, complete with her catsuit and beautiful voice, but more to the point because of the depth of the role she is given and the skill with which she pulls it off. She is alone, until she befriends the policeman, and cut off, and woefully ill-equipped to deal with her foe. Yet she approaches it with good humour, pulling the leg of the incredulous detective (once she has proved her bona-fides) about her alien abilities. Initially, she seems like a normal Earth person, describing the inhabitants of Earth as ""a human race"". However, gradually, differences emerge. It is these things, and the way they are treated, which give the characters depth.<br /><br />For example, at one point he discovers she has one particularly extraordinary ability. When she realizes he doesn't share this gift, her response is ""And you say I'M not normal!"" It hadn't occurred to her that he couldn't do it. These differences cause occasional surprise, humour and, sometimes, exasperation. But she learns to use them to advantage, and when she couples them with her feminine wiles, with a wink and a nod, she can be quite effective.<br /><br />She doesn't go through the movie as the standard smart-mouthed, sassy, kick-but uber space trooper, blowing everything away and taking no lip, which is what could have ruined this movie. Instead she uses her brains (including her knowledge of bio-science), good humour and charm, and barely resorts to firepower and then only as a last resort. (Her policeman friend does most of the blowing away.) The dialogue works well, and is often original (refer to Ta'ra's opinions on space ship self-destruct systems).<br /><br />These qualities give the characters depth and, thus, add to the realism and tension.<br /><br />And the special effects are reasonably good, with the exception of the usual nonsense about what happens in vacuums.<br /><br />So I give the movie an 8 out of 10.<br /><br />The subsequent television series wasn't as good. It becomes something of a standard cop programme, with ray guns. And Ta'ra's character hasn't the depth. For example, suddenly she develops an ability to develop super-weapons. Where did that come from in our ship's medical officer? If you were stranded on another planet, how many advanced weapons do you think you could build? I don't think so!",unsup

They join forces trying to eliminate the menace to planet Earth.<br /><br />""Something Is Out There"" is a very good sci-fi/horror B-movie, using a similar storyline of ""The Hidden"" (1987).

That TV movie was 'Something is Out There'. They had taped it so they could watch some dumb sitcom instead. I felt a nagging urge to see what it was they were talking about.<br /><br />Man were they ever right. Not only was it really gory and freaky to boot, but it was one of the coolest TV films I've ever seen. You've got the mysterious killer mutilating NY residents, the hot chick who claims to be from from outer space, the drunk/loser detective, and one of the nastiest villains to ever grace the small screen.<br /><br />#1, I was taken for a loop. I thought the killer was jsut an ordinary psycho who loved to eviscerate joggers... but when it turns out to be an psychopathic alien fugitive that can disguise itself as anyone it wants, I was put into a mild state of shock.<br /><br />#2, For a TV film, the FX are awesome (for the time period). This was before the computer FX revolution, so they look 'real'.

The sets and fighting scenes are poor. The direction is disjointed and the editing clumsy. Nonetheless the film has great charm. The tragic tale of Prince Asoka, the great emperor and disperser of Bhuddism, probably bears no greater resemblance to history than does Shakespeare's MacBeth or Anthony and Cleopatra. But it does have something profound to say and its format as a tragedy can be moving. The lead actors are competent and the script is deserving of better treatment.

I don't know if this historically accurate or not, but it is historic enough to give you an idea of Asoka's story, the rise to power, Battle of Kalinga, change to Buddhism, all these are addressed. Everything had the hall mark of a great movie. The grandeur of the Mauryan empire was palpable. Asoka's evil in his rise to power, his ruinous campaigns for the empire were not just seen and heard, but felt. Absolutely awesome was the battle- the scale of the battle, the destruction, the disaster, the hatred and then the repentance, the scenes say it all absolutely wordlessly (Mark the scene where Asoka offers the dying soldier water, and he refuses to take it from the hated Asoka). Karuwaki's ""you're Asok"" deserves a place amongst the best scenes ever.

1121_0,"I actually had free tickets to this film but forwent using them after seeing the terrible write-ups: Tired buddy film; Samuel Jackson couldn't look more bored... etc. In contrast, after finally renting it, I found it to be a very entertaining film with roles that seemed to fit the actors like a favorite chair. If Jackson looked bored it was because his character was bored -- alive but not living -- and Jackson pulled it off very well. Many people here have referred to it as a rip-off buddy-film but I wonder if they aren't just buying into the dime-a-dozen reviews; or perhaps they are buddy-film connoisseur's and have some authority on it all when actually this movie deserves to be seen for itself. Personally, I can't call this a buddy film since they were not buddies in any sense of the word. More like Shaft meets Felix Unger. As well, there seems to be a consensus that there was a lot of bathroom humor. I think the fart scenes could have been left out, although the first is an almost a deserved scene to accentuate the burned out bad boy and over the top good boy irony; and the cavity search seemed totally unnecessary and basically out of character for the movie or at least out of place except the director felt uncomfortable with any ""aww""s certain scenes might have evoked.<br /><br />Beyond that, Les Mayfield was using slapschtick humor, and the lot of them -- Jackson, Levy, Goss and Mayfield, seemed to pull it all off with an almost Buster Keaton style; the epitome of poker-faced comedy whereby the humor is delivered in a brown paper bag instead of a piñata spewing candy all over you (or worse, a pie in the face).<br /><br />Levy is perfect as the bumbling salesman whose dreams peak at the hope of having a standing ovation for his presentation on the latest dentistry tools in his text-book nerd attire and over-indulgence in self-obsessed righteousness; while Jackson is impeccable as the rouge untrusting, seen-too-much undercover agent rotely implementing his down-to-a-science head-banging and snitch chasing, which brings purpose to his life but of which the passion and excitement of it all elude him. While the entertainment value lies squarely in the interaction between these two polar opposites, there is a not so subtle gaining of qualities from each to the other.

Writer-director Santosh Sivan set out to make this loosely historical epic young Emperor Asoka, one of the India's greatest emperors of the Maurya Dynasty from 273 BCE to 232 BCE.<br /><br />Though the story is largely fictional, Sivan uses actual historical figures and tells the story in the context of the events of the day. From its opening moments detailing Asoka's trust for the sword to the sumptuous splendor of the battlefield defining the skill of Asoka's swordsmanship, the visuals of the film Asoka are simply breathtaking. Blending an eye for detail in production design, Sivan brings the long-dead civilization back to life like no other Hindi film has done before. First and foremost, a big round of applause to not only Sivan for orchestrating this enjoyable historical jaunt and evocative cinematography, but also Manish Malhotra for the gorgeous costume design and John Kundan Pai for the beautiful production designs. Stunning ancient architecture, strategic use of curtains and lighting, and absolutely stunning garb work with the unique camera angles to bring the ancient era to light. Scholarly issues aside, this is the kind of film that defines the term 'masterpiece' filled with spectacle and action, and telling a story of epic scope and humanity. Asoka is an enthralling and totally immersing production that will probably be viewed as a Hindi classic paving the way to films like Jodha Akbar.<br /><br />Asoka and Kaurwaki (unbeknown to her that he is indeed her love Pawan), gather their forces for the final show down confrontation known to history as the Battle of Kalinga, whose outcome decided the fate of civilization and destiny of Asoka. A man who began his life as an emperor but ended as a monk achieving what he dreamt of which is to become the greatest emperor in history, that is emperor of hearts. The reticence pays off near the end when screenwriter provides the characters with a provocative and literate debate about the nature of war.<br /><br />Though many will remember the film for its violent and edge-of-your-seat battles, there is a lot of humanity found within this film, which builds up nicely to the film's emotionally satisfying climax. Sivan chooses to devote a fair amount of time focusing on Asoka's worrier Princess Kaurwaki, played beautifully by Kareena Kapoor. Her character is as violent, sensual, and full of intrigue her counterpart Prince Asoka. This complex love relationship between two people from rival kingdoms is expanded upon from its historical reference to portray Kaurwaki as a strong willed and passionate woman. There are few of passionate (I say not enough) moments between Asoka and Princess Kaurwaki highlighted by the music sequences tossed in to balance out the brutal and savage war scenes (not to mention a smoking-hot wet scenes of Shahrukh and Kareena) making the film worthwhile to watch.<br /><br />What raises Asoka above the usual epic drama is not only the strength of its story but power of its performances.

11221_0,"I've finally got down to viewing Asoka in its entirety, given that my closest shave was when it screened on television some years back, but I got interrupted with an extremely long phone call, which left me with only 10 minutes into the start, and the last 10. Yes, I knew how it ended, but who's satisfied without getting at the meat? Moreover, the complaints that surrounded the film also intrigued me, as it really seemed that the dramatic license taken to interpret a BC-era story had met with plenty of objections for not being historically accurate.<br /><br />Given India's rich history, there isn't a lack of stories involving kings of the past, such as that portrayed in Ashutosh Gowariker's Jodhaa Akbar. Asoka took on similar romantic proportions, in that at its core it has a love story to tell, rather than one focused on waging war throughout the lands, although this was touched upon in the latter half of the film, stemming from a death of his heart, and the embracing of a rage against the known world.<br /><br />The first half introduces us to the star-crossed lovers, and the usual boy-meets-and-woos formula. Asoka (Shah Rukh Khan), being the favourite son of the Magahda empire, is in line for the throne, to the detest of his brothers. Rather than allow the family to disintegrate into chaos, his mum sends him away in exile to his objection, but his love for his mom meant obedience, and he journeys into rival kingdom of Kalinga incognito as a commoner. That of course still doesn't stop his brothers, especially the next in line Susima (Ajit Kumar) from continuous plotting his eradication.<br /><br />Then there's Kareena Kapoor (credited as Karriena Kapoor, in her first pair up with SRK and looking more voluptuous than her skinnier self now) as Kaurwaki, the princess who together with the king-in-waiting Prince Aryan (Sooraj Balaji) and their trusted general Bheema (Rahul Dev) are in hiding because of a plot from someone in the democratic senate out to murder them to take over the throne. So you have set up a Romeo & Juliet circumstance, where descendants of the royal households fall in love, and also have to deal with the rubbish politics back home which bays for their blood.<br /><br />The film paints a very emotional Asoka that Shah Rukh Khan excelled in bringing out, especially when three women in his life played an important part in his life-changing decisions, such as his mom's involvement for him to see the outside world, Kaurwaki in being his first true, and unattainable love that he yearns and pines for, and his eventual wife Devi (Hrishitaa Bhatt), a Buddhist who would be instrumental in his embracing of the religion after coming to his senses in the aftermath of his most brutal war waged just because of his insatiable appetite for more territory, though of course done in the name of uniting India.<br /><br />But with romance out of the way, SRK also showed off the result of his training in the numerous swordfights he gets put into. The designers here had made his calling card, a ""demonic"" sword that has a bloodlust, resemble a little like He-Man's power sword, but without mythical influences of course. The other weapon that he wields, which is the more impressive of the two, is a double-bladed bendy-sword, which functions more closely as a whip. Nasty piece of equipment that, though Kareena herself do have set action sequences dedicated to her and showed she's no pushover too.<br /><br />While the story shows how Asoka transforms through the stages, the middle section surprisingly was the best part, as it was the bridge between the two distinct halves which straddles the romance and the warrior aspects. Here Santosh Sivan and Saket Chaudhary's screenplay takes on liberties into bridging the two together, and it's quite engaging, with that sense of dramatic irony always omnipresent, and Fate having a field day with the characters involved, providing a catalyst for that inevitable charge toward change. It's somewhat predictable of course, but presents that sense of impending doom and gloom that the narrative turns towards.<br /><br />For a film made in 2001, the editing here did seem a little jarring, but further research explained that this was inherent to the version of the DVD viewed, which included a very obvious missing Interval title-card, which splits the film into two given the industry's run time for films. The song sequences of the movies now try not to have spatial and time warps and transportations, and for a film back then, it's still a technique (if you will) used to put the romancing characters in far out locales and situations. I'm not complaining, since my favourite song of the film has this incredible dance sequence between King Khan and Kareena (choreographed by Farah Khan) beautifully filmed against some surreal, haunting backdrops.<br /><br />I feel that this interpretation for the screen would also suffice, though stopping short at what Asoka is more renowned for, the propagation of Buddhist teachings across asia, and his emblem, the Chakra, emblazoned on the Indian flag of today.",unsup
11222_0,"The movie is a good entertainer. It is a portrayal of Asoka as a normal human being rather than a great king who stands out from normal people. And as much is not recorded abt his life, the director has taken the liberty to make it like a fairy tale. And he has done it amazingly well! The things that stand out are the breathtaking scenes and the acting. Santhosh has proved yet again why he is the best cinematographer in India. The role of asoka in this movie required someone with a wide range of acting skills, to portray the different shades of the character(asoka), as he progress through his life. SRK, one of the few who could have done it, has carried out his task with perfection! Its also very interesting to note how well the fight sequences have been taken. I never expected the war scenes to be of this standard in a bollywood movie.",unsup
11223_0,"`Asoka' is a story of love and war. In the end love conquers all, no pun intended. I would say it's one-third `Gladiator', one-third `The Patriot' and the rest is a typical love story that comes with Hindi films; boy meets girl.. et al. The scenes were edge of your seat suspense, guessing and enthusiastically awaiting the next. The music was different, not too much song and dance but it was very soulful music that related to the story. Kareena's performance was outstanding. Her role was powerful, I don't think just about anyone could've done it; she carried it out well. She definitely earned her spot as one of the best in Bollywood. As always, ShahRukh was remarkable. He played an aggressively barbaric and cold-hearted warrior but underneath his heavy armor and seriousness, you'll find that same charismatic ShahRukh that wooed us in ""KKHH"". All in all, I recommend `Asoka' to anyone who's looking for something different. It has everything, action, heart and a little humor. I will warn you that it gets nauseously graphic with body parts flying allover. Viewer discretion is advised.",unsup
11224_0,"This film, combining familiar elements of epics such as Gladiator and Braveheart, is directed by the internationally renowned Indian director Santosh Sivan. Sivan is primarily known for his low-budget arthouse hit, The Terrorist. ""Asoka"" is quite different from The Terrorist in both scale and starpower. Shah Rukh Khan, India's biggest star, plays the Mauryan Emperor Asoka, who wages bloody wars across the country only to renounce violence when he witnesses the aftermath of the destruction he causes. Drawn from legends and folk tales about the emperor, much of the film is not historical fact. However, the narrative provides true entertainment. Some criticism: ""Asoka"" seems to be using the same ""Bollywood"" love story formula, and augmenting the story of Asoka onto that formula. If it had been the other way around, this film would have been far more intriguing and relevent. Most of the movie revolves around his romance with his one true love, princess Kaurwaki, played by Kareena Kapoor. We are left not knowing much about Asoka's message of peace, only his trials with love. On top of that, the poor song and dance numbers in the film disrupt the narrative flow. On the other hand, while Anu Malik does a bad job with the composition of the songs, the composers Sandeep Chowta and Ranjit Barot weave a superb musical score seamlessly into the film. Even with its faults, ""Asoka"" is gripping through and through with spectacular battle scenes, fine acting by Khan and also, notably, Ajit Kumar, who plays Asoka's duplicitous brother Susima. Techincally, the film is unbeatable by any other Indian film to date. The editing is fast paced and spectacularly done by Sreekar Prasad, the premier film editor of India. The direction is magnificent, and above all else, the cinematography, done by Sivan himself, is indescribably gorgeous. It is sumptuous, and spectacularly vivid. Sivan is regarded as one of the world's premiere cinematogaphers, and this film is proof positive of that. This film should, like Aamir Khan's ""Lagaan"", be able to break through to western audiences. All in all, a great acheivement.",unsup
11225_0,"A blend of old-world atavism and crystal clear imagery, compounded with lush art direction and stirring music, Asoka is a haunting journey into the life of India's greatest emperor. The film is extremely stylish in its mix of Indian aesthetic and contemporary simplicity which reflects in the art direction by Sabu Cyril and pleasing costume design. The performances throughout the film are spot on with Shah Rukh Khan ruling the roost once again with his stupendous and sincere portrayal of Asoka, his myriad emotions and thoughts shining like a mirror in every frame. Kareena Kapoor as Kaurwaki makes a beautiful and sensuous princess, commanding the screen with a presence, that few of her contemporaries can rival. The highlight of the movie is of course the surreal envisioning of the Great War of Kalinga, which is breathtakingly choreographed with a scale that could stand in good stead with some Hollywood films. Technically, Asoka has few rivals. The cinematography is A-class and the editing crisp. Sivan's script is tightly woven with moments of passion and intrigue erupting at regular intervals keeping the viewer gripped. For all practical purposes Asoka is a winner, and comes through in style mesmerizing the audience with its spectacular visuals and searing their souls with its haunting portrayal of truth.<br /><br />",unsup
11226_0,"On a third viewing on DVD I am confirmed in my opinion that this is not only the best historical film produced in India but that is as good as the best Hollywood films such as Gladiator and Braveheart. Both the latter films are not historically accurate but Asoka is as near the truth as one can get about Asoka most of whose history is also historical speculation. The film makes very credible narrative of the pre Buddhist phase of Asoka and his conversion. Kaurwaki is also a historical figure as she is the only queen whose name appears in Asoka inscriptions.<br /><br />The film is beautiful and imaginative and has beautiful scenery and music. It follows the Indian cinema conventions in including song and dance sequences which appeal to audiences not only in the subcontinent but across the Middle East, North Africa and South East Asia. <br /><br />Shah Rukh Khan is superb as the young Asoka. Especially well done are his sequences in Magadha with his brothers and father and his later scenes in war and the Kalinga battlefield with the remorse and repentance.I have certainly not seen anything in Indian cinema to compare with this. Laurence Olivier's Hamlet and Henry V come to mind. The film is worth multiple viewings and one should certainly own a DVD.",unsup
11227_0,"This movie is so good and made very well. I feel it was as big of masterpiece as Braveheart. The art direction couldn't feel any more epic. The war was the best part as it shows it was one of the most bloodiest battles. The art direction is perfect. The background music is spellbinding. However, the story flaws because Asoka's story has been made for a movie which is the only problem I have with the movie (More on this later).<br /><br />But one performance nobody will ever forget is SRK's. Shahrukh Khan gives an awesome performance. It is a shocker how he did not get nominated for an award for this movie. It is ten times better than his K3G performance. Yet Kareena Kapoor is a revelation (after her second two films). Roles like Refugee and this will get her somewhere. Roles like Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai, Yaadein, and too an extent K3g are a threat to her career. Rahul Dev and Danny Denzongpa are a nice addition to the cast. Hrishitta Bhatt, who makes an excellent debut, and Sooraj Balaji, a good child star, prove that awards are highly overrated. <br /><br />The songs have an epic feeling, and fit the film very well. Roshni Se is an awesome song and arguably the best song in the soundtrack. Raat Ka Nasha is another good song mainly due to Chitra's singing and Kareena's excellent emoting. San Sanana is a catchy song. O Re Kaanchi is a fun dance song with excellent dancing by Kareena Kapoor. Aa Tayar Hoja is an interesting song with good choreography as it shows typical male entertainment from that time. <br /><br />I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 initially, but I now gave it a seven. The reason being is this movie is quite inaccurate. They don't show his transition to Buddhism and his life after Buddhism are given no significance. All they really showed was his love with Kaurwaki who was not even a princess (just a fisher woman). They also gave no significance to Devi, who was much more important in Asoka's life. It is primarily a love story. That sucks because this movie was so good, but that flaw always interferes whenever I see the movie (even though the movie states it is not a true story). With the consent of that, this movie is truly a masterpiece (if you ignore the accuracy) and is worth a watch.",unsup
11228_0,"SPECIAL NOTE: Although this film is based on a true historical character, however, the film is not intended to depict a documentry on the real Asoka's life/journey as was in reality. Most of the film is highly dramatized for the entertainment value. This film does however provide very basic information about the actual Kalinga War and asoka's transformation from a hindu to a buddist.<br /><br />Synopsis-<br /><br />Asoka (Shahrukh Khan) grows up fascinated with a voilent weapon and hopes that it will in return bring him great power and respect. The setting of the story is in the 2nd century B.C. in the kingdom of Magadha of south central India. Eventually Asoka grows up to be a great furious fighting warrior winning many wars and battles thus expanding the entire Mauryan Empire. Asoka's goal is to become the new head of the throne which was currently headed by his elder brother Susima (Ajith). Susima, whom becomes extremely jealous of Asoka quick rising fame and power, try's many indirect attempts to have Asoka killed before he reaches the throne but sadly for susima, he fails at all attempts to have asoka killed. Asoka's journey later continues when he is asked to leave the Kingdom of Magadha by his mother Dharma (Subhasini Ali) and for him to go in his own path. Asoka decides to go to Kalinga, on his new journey, he meets a wise buddist who tells him that his journey is larger than just heading the throne of Magadha. Asoka also meets and falls in love with a strange women Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor) also known to be Princess Kaurwaki of Kalinga. As the story develops more, Asoka and Kaurwaki get married but on the day of their marriage, Asoka is asked to return to Magadha as news makes him aware that his mother is very ill. As the entire story from here unfolds, things take a real big turn, as Asoka does indeed become larger than just retaining the throne, he also loses his communication with Kaurwaki and her younger brother Arya (Suraj Balaji) and the story leaves you with a shocking and questionable ending.<br /><br />Technicality-<br /><br />This film has dynamite Cinematography (Santosh Sivan) & Art Direction (Sabu Cyril), its easily compariable to the likes of Santosh Sivan's other great works such as The Terrorist and Mina Nair's Kamasutra and almost to the likes of Peter Pau & Jian-Quo Wang Chrouching Tigers, Hidden Dragon. For a commerical bollywood film, its cinematography & art direction is the most exotic & decadent works in reccent times and it actually makes one believe that the setting was indeed the second century B.C. of Ancient India. One can also easily debate weather Santosh Sivan's cinematography alone had a message of its own inrelations to the story. He is perhaps one of India's most thought-provoking film cinematographers ever. However, technicality, these are perhaps the films two biggest plus points. As good as that area is, other technicality ares strongly disappoint just as well. A. Sreekar Prasad's film editing & Sandeep Chowta's background musical score is very poor. Many times through out the film, it felt that the story was being rushed and that each scene wasn't shown with full justise. This is hard to believe, as A. Sreekar Prasad has done some excellent film editing for previous films such as Dil Chahta Hai and The Terrorist. Even most of the songs were not shown with proper starting and/or ending, I've even noticed that bits of each song was deleted inbetween to kick forward the movie ahead. Only thought that comes to my mind when realizing this is, Why? Which brings me to the background musical score by Sandeep Chowta, there were some parts in the movie where background score was loud and annoying and I felt that some scenes would have turned out to be better without any background music just so that the scene can be simple just as its setting, by adding the background music made the look of those certain scene unrealistic and more of a fantasy, which is a total turn off. Even some action fighting sequences (excluding the Kalinga War) were poor. However, the Kalinga War itself wasn't the works of anything original, I spotted a few scenes which were ripped off from Hollywood movies such as The Patriot & Gladiator. Though I totally don't disrespect the entire Kalinga War scene, as it is one of my favorite scenes of the movie.<br /><br />Performances-<br /><br />Shah Rukh Khan is really good, Asoka is perhaps his best performance since Mohabbatein and Hey Ram. He is especially good in the second half of the film as his character takes on some major changes and Shahrukh Khan does good justice to each transformation. His performance is bound to get him a nomination for best actor in most award ceremonies next year. But it is Kareena Kapoor whoes performance suprises the most from the entire cast, this is her best attempt at acting since her dabute. She had a very challenging character which took many twist and turns, and she played it perfect to the T. She too is bound to get a nominee for best actress for her performance in Asoka at most award ceremonies next year. Other commendable performances should go to Suraj Balaji, whom portrayed the cute, innocent yet brave little younger brother of Kaurwaki. Also, not to mention Rahul Dev and first time newcommer Hrishitaa Bhatt for there commendable performances. And Johnny Lever, whom as always provides great comic releif.<br /><br />Overall Thoughts-<br /><br />The film's greatest trademark are its Cinematography & Art Direction which hold really strong from start to finsih, and this was easily expected from this film because you have two masterminds working on it side by side. The first half of the film is so-so because of its poor film editing. But thank goodness for the second half, the story really begins to catch attention, and the main performances really begin to appeal to the eyes. Santosh Sivan's overall direction is good, although his work in the Terrorist is easily superior than Asoka in the direction department. So does Asoka have a repeat viewing value? I would say that it does in most cases, mainly thanks to its overall look and a strong second half film for its saviour. However, A bit of more depiction of Asoka becoming a buddist would have been more appricated. Though it is not the best film of the year (2001) and it cannot be compared to the quality of Lagaan through its story telling, but its definilty one of the top five films of 2001. But one thing I cannot stop addressing enough of is that, from the point of view of its Cinematography & Art Direction, Asoka is a true classic, its definitly a visual feast to the eye.",unsup

One day while in exile, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful runaway princess names Kaurwaki (played to the best of her ability by Kareena Kapoor, considering that this role was supposed to be for Aishwarya Rai who personifies the meaning of beauty more than Kapoor ever could) and after a few song and dance numbers, they marry each other in the deserted forests. They are existing happily until one day members of Asoka's family track him down to tell him that his father as taken ill, and this makes him end his exile to return home. He promises to return for Kaurwaki (who doesn't know that he is himself a prince) but due to unforeseen circumstances, he is unable to return to her as ends up marrying a smitten young caretaker (played by Hrishitaa Bhatt).

11234_0,"I enjoyed this film immensely. I had never seen a Bollywood film before this, and given that I love to sing and dance and watch romance, this film filled my needs and desires. It may not satisfy others' needs or desires, especially if realistic action/fighting scenes are required, or fantastic acting skills, or seamless dialogue. Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor meld delightfully in their romance, but after seeing a few other movies with these two superstars in them, I admit their acting skills are not exceptional-I noticed that their facial expression and vocal fluctuations are almost identical in other films. It seemed to me that they each brought themselves and their stardom to the scene more than the essence of the characters they were portraying. Maybe this is simply a trait of Bollywood actors and actresses across the board-understandable, since they make so many movies, it would be quite difficult to really learn each character and portray it believably. That being said, I loved Shah Rukh Khan's big hooked nose and his eyebrows, and Kareena Kapoor's beauty and personality beamed through this film. I have yet to see a Bollywood film with comparable dance scenes (I love dancing along to ""O Re Kanche"") and unforgettable music. The elements used in the cinematography for ""Roshine Se"" were beautiful. There are some other memorable shots that stick with you,for example, the memory of the spilt milk, that hold the magicalness of the chance gathering of all involved in making this film, the essence of something beautiful and perfect that will probably never come together again. That essence is as poignant and lingering as Indian spices, and that is why I love Asoka.",unsup
11235_0,"2001, in spite of everything, might be remembered as the year Bollywood met Hollywood in the flesh. Years from now, film historians, critics, and fans will remember this film as a landmark, an unparalleled achievement. This incredible film really needs to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated fully.<br /><br />Santosh Sivan, the gifted cinematographer best known in the USA for the art-house hit ""The Terrorist,"" and in India for his work with director Mani Ratnam, switches gears completely. While ""The Terrorist"" was a tiny, contemplative drama, ""Asoka"" is bigger than big, a total opposite. In fact, I read that the war sequence was the largest of its kind ever filmed in the history of Indian cinema.<br /><br />Asoka, a little-known figure in the West, was a bloodthirsty maniac who became a bastion for peace and tolerance through Buddhism in the 3rd century, ce. The film is a journey, a character study, of Asoka's progression to the time when he first embraced the Buddha. Some have complained that there is nothing in the film about his conversion to Buddhism, but that is really not the film's point. The events that led up to this transformation are what the film is really about.<br /><br />Particular attention needs to be made to the cinematography and editing--it is nothing short of extraordinary. Done with an uncanny sensitivity, Sivan brings third century India to breathing, bustling life in a way that, perhaps, no one else could deliver with such vitality and beauty. However, portions of the editing are a little too MTV for my taste, with white flashes and jump-cuts interrupting establishing shots. It functions well, though, during the fight scenes. It is a strange dichotomy between art and commercial cinema. You'll never see swordplay in the same way again.<br /><br />Pay attention to the acting, too--it is excellent. Kareena Kapoor proves that she's a much finer actress than her older sister, Karisma, and Shahrukh Khan, currently India's biggest star, gives the performance of his life. Both show incredible nuances. Also, Suraj Balaje, who plays the young prince Arya, shows a surprising maturity, and even comedian Johnny Lever, in a cameo role as a soldier, is excellent. If you are not familiar with commercial Indian cinema, the acting may seem like it is a bit over the top, but here, the entire cast, especially the leads, shows tremendous restraint. Know, however, that the over-the-top acting style, a staple of commercial Indian cinema, has a direct connection to traditions that are hundreds and hundreds years old, in the classical styles of the Sanskrit and Parsee theater.<br /><br />The inevitable comparisons between ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Asoka"" are warranted. This is the first commercial Indian film to receive nationwide distribution in the US, in this case through the independent First Look Pictures, and it is poised to bring an otherwise unknown film-making tradition in the American mainstream to a wide US audience. Both films are sumptuous recreations of history, although this film is based on an actual historical figure and CTHD is based on a novel. Both films have amazing fight choreography, ""Asoka's"" done without the aid of computers. Personally, I am biased towards commercial Indian cinema because it holds much more of a mystique. Sadly, because of the image that commercial Indian cinema holds in the USA, it may never see the wide audience that this film so deserves.<br /><br />Whereas the Hong Kong action picture has heavy doses of martial arts, the commercial Indian film has songs, akin to musicals but, in this case, more like music videos. There are five songs in the film, and they may be a turn-off to those not familiar with mainstream Indian cinema. However, they are well-integrated into the story-line, and they are among the best filmi (Indian film songs) I have ever heard, combining modern and ancient instruments with just a touch of electronica. The film really loses some of its impact if they are cut--they are that important. They are well-picturized (term for the filming of musical numbers in Indian cinema), and provide additional atmosphere. The influence of MTV is apparent in the editing style that takes over during the song sequences; this may interrupt the film's rhythm and impact, but they are part of the overall story. Unfortunately, I believe that the song sequences are being cut severely for international release, although I was lucky enough to see them in full DTS digital sound. Because of the need for Indian cinema to appeal to as wide an audience as possible (the ""all-India film""), and because film-going in India is a family experience, films try to appeal to all members of the family. This means that violent scenes can turn into comedy, many genres are often combined, and there is neither sex nor nudity, not even kissing on the lips, because of a puritanical society. Overall, this may be seem cheesy to American audiences, but this is one of the pleasures of commercial Indian cinema. It is strange, though, with its lack of any nudity or sex, which are all suggested but never shown, that the film received an R rating. Yes, it is VERY violent, but the violence is quite stylized and often uses the power of suggestion rather than actual representation. I hope sincerely that, when First Look releases the DVD, the film is completely uncut and complete, with ALL the songs.<br /><br />The film's last song, ""Raat Ka Nasha,"" would be my Oscar pick for best song, an exemplar of superior filmi. The film itself definitely deserves an Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film. It is a big bonus to see a film of such high production values devoid of any references to Western civilization or without any Western aesthetics. Incredibly entertaining, something for everyone (music, drama, romance, violence), with unparalleled high-quality production values and a moving story, ""Asoka"" is a dynamite cinematic experience. It is that good.",unsup
11236_0,"Asoka is tender story of a great emperor. what i love about it is beautiful, mystifying music. combination of good looking and professional actors is a good advantage of the movie. this movie is not like the rest of the hindi movies. usually, hindi movies target India and neighboring countries and gulf (arab) countries as well. since this one is VERY well done, I think this time the audience will include Europe (it was a great success in England) and USA (Shahrukh Khan himself came to NY). Shahrukh Khan was voted as the sexiest man in Asia and his partner is considered as the sexiest babe in India, a grandaughter of a dynasty of actors in India. if u like professionally made quality movies, if u like some chemistry, romance, love combined with action in battlefield, excellent music and hot actors in a meaningful movie, ASOKA is definitely yours. u gotta watch it for sure then. trust on my word.",unsup

If you are rating the film based on its historical accuracy, its a complete flop. and, honestly, i was a little disappointed in the ending...or lack of....but either way i love the music, cinematography, and everything else. Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor have great chemistry together...Kareena is really a great actress when she isn't playing a dumb ditz (such as in K3G....). And Rahul Dev is pretty good too.<br /><br />If this movie weren't ""based on the life of Asoka"", I think it would have been a lot better. But It it is still totally worth watching.",unsup
11238_0,"I think some of the commenters misunderstand a few points<br /><br />1) It's not only about love and war, but rivals within the family. He didn't kill his brother because he was so vicious but because of how he was treated. No one even talks about the pain that Asoka had to go through. And I haven't seen Braveheart or Gladiator but American films don't often show that.<br /><br />2) As it coping it's ideas, what bullshit. Americans copied from Japanese ideas and they copied from us. And I think that they're on the verge of making it bigger here, just like Japanese movies and that they will eventually have their own way of directing. You give too little credit when you have no right to judge so hard.<br /><br />3) In the beginning of the movie they tell you that there is fiction in it so your expected that it's not exactly how it went but made to be more interesting for the viewers. Now how often does that happen? (Rhetorical) unless in the version you watched they didn't say that. But if they did you should have acknowledged that it wasn't all about the truth but about the movie.<br /><br />",unsup
11239_0,"Like AKS and LAGAAN this year, ASOKA is brilliant technically. The cinematography. The art direction and period costumes. The audio and visual effects are up to par with Hollywood flicks. The use of background score and lighting. Overall production is very crisp.<br /><br />Along with those other films, I think 2001 has been a watershed year in terms of Indian cinema advancement...kind of like 1999 was for Hollywood movies (THE MATRIX, JOHN MALKOVICH, SIXTH SENSE). Especially, when you put it into perspective of some of the really BAD and embarrasing films of the 80's that you wouldn't have dared show your non-Indian friends. Throw in films like GADAR and DIL CHATHA HAI...that were very good movies in different ways, and you have to start respecting the Bollywood Film Industry.<br /><br /> Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Would've been REALLY cool if we could've seen it in IMAX format in NYC.<br /><br /> Storywise, this is the really the first big budget Indian Epic that I can remember...very strongly influenced by GLADIATOR. Based in another period (3rd Century BC), An heir to the throne is threatened by the presence of a more capable, beloved, and decorated military commander who he tries to get rid of by all means necessary -- eventually getting him exiled (of sorts) where he becomes a commoner. It had the aspects of a historical epic that you'd expect -- love, betrayal, war.<br /><br /> The storyline got lost at times during some non-essential, tangential, and unnecessarily stretched out segments and some aspects regarding the rivalry between Asoka and his older brother Susima is underdeveloped. The movie could have been much more effective if shortened (like GADAR and LAGAAN) without losing anything. In fact, doing so would probably make it much more appealing to a Western audience. But Shah Rukh pulled off the role of Asoka very well, weakening my argument that he's a one-dimensional actor. I didn't think Kareena was the best choice Kaulwaki....although I can't really think of many of today's actresses that would have done a good job (I think Sridevi in her prime would have been awesome). And who was this new actress that played Shah Rukh's Buddhist wife, Devi? Whoa. My cousin hit it dead on when she said that she (I just looked it up on the internet, her name is Hrishitaa Bhatt) looked like an Indian Alyssa Milano (who I was totally in love with when I was 12 years old during the 80's TV show Who's the Boss?). Okay, otherwise, she wasn't very compelling as an actress...but ""she looked good!""<br /><br /> Overall, I really thought highly of this movie for it's technical and artistic content and I would recommend either watching it on the big screen or on DVD to really appreciate the best aspects. To watch it on one of those really grainy fourthhand pirated videotapes would be a waste...",unsup

Jackson was great, even Kathryn Greenwood, from ""Whose Line is it Anyway?"", played the great flight attendant. This movie is full of hilarious lines, which I'm sure you'll be quoting, and some incredibly funny situations. From slapstick to serious comedy, this movie has it all, all wrapped up into a great story that will keep you rolling and crying.

11240_0,"This movie is underrated and deserves more then the 6.8 from the users' rating here in IMDb. Shahrukh Khan is totally hot and perfect as Asoka, but I don't understand why so many people are saying bad things about the actress Kareena Kapoor, that in my opinion, was also nice in the role of Kaurwaki. Well, Whatever:<br /><br />''Asoka'' is a very beautiful film, with a great cinematography, scenarios and clothes. It is also a great epic from the Indian movies that deserves to be watched by people of all ages, and even not being 100% faithful about the real Asoka's life, it is a great adaptation of it. The only two things I need to complain are :<br /><br />+ The songs, that are not a masterpiece like in ''Lagaan'' and also doesn't have anything to do with the story of the movie. In most of the Indian movies , the songs always have lyrics about what is happening to the characters. In ''Asoka'' they don't.<br /><br />+ The end of the film. After the tension if Kaurwaki and Asoka are going to be together or not, the end should show at least a little bit about their lives as a noble couple. Another thing I missed, was to see the good things Asoka did for his people, like spreading the Buddhism and doing great constructions and monuments. It would help the end to be better, specially after seeing such a massive destruction and annihilation.<br /><br />Finally, many things of ''Asoka'' remembers me another great epic movie called ''Atilla'', that is directed by Dick Lowry: the way Asoka stays angry and starts to be a monster ,killing everybody after the supposed death of Kaurwaki, is very similar of Atilla 's behavior when his wife N'Kara dies.<br /><br />And Kauwarki being undercover and protected by General Bheema, remembers me a classic from Akira Kurosawa,''Kakushi-toride no san-akunin''', more well known as ''The Hidden fortress'', where the general Rokurota Makabe takes care of princess yuki in an identical situation of Kauwarki.<br /><br />Prince Asoka,after leaving his kingdom by his mother's wishes (since he is being hunted by his own brothers), falls in love with the beautiful princess Kaurwaki. Kaurwaki doesn't know he is a prince, but eventually falls in love with him too, spite of the efforts of the general to let her safe from everybody, since she and her brother are being hunted by the Kallinga traitors.<br /><br />But when Asoka returns his kingdom to talk with his mother, he doesn't find Kaurwaki , thinking that she was killed by the Kallinga traitors, he falls into despair and becomes a brutal emperor.",unsup

Asoka's mother orders him to leave Magadha to save his life, and while traveling, he meets Princess Kaurwaki (Karriena Kapoor) and her brother, Prince Aryan (Sooraj Balaji) from Kalinga, who are undercover and protected by General Bheema (Rahul Dev). Asoka and Kaurwaki falls in love for each other, but the mother of Asoka calls him back to Magadha. When he returns to Kaurwaki, he does not find her, since she was attacked by traitors of Kalinga and was hidden in the house of a loyal vassal. When Asoka's mother is killed by a man of Susima, Asoka becomes mad, kills all his evil brothers but Sugatra, who escapes to Kalinga. Asoka decides to conquer Kalinga, but in the end, he concludes that he has not built an empire, but conquered only corpses and destroyed everything, and he decides to spread love and the Buddhism with his son and his daughter.<br /><br />""Asoka"" is a spectacular epic from Bolywood. In Brazil, there are very few Indian movies released on DVD, but all of them are excellent. ""Asoka"" is one of the best, with a beautiful romance, very dramatic situations and great actions scenes, and a touching conclusion. The actress Karriena Kapoor is extremely beautiful and sexy, and has a great chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan. The boy Sooraj Balaji has a great performance in the role of a prince. Unfortunately the lyrics of the songs have not been translated in the Brazilian DVD. From other Bolywood movies, I am sure that the songs are very important, since they always tell something about the feelings of the characters in that moment. By the way, the music score is excellent. My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Asoka""",unsup
11242_0,"I have to say, that after thinking about it for awhile, I really enjoyed this movie. Its growing on me, even now.. It was visually stunning... really beautiful to look at. Of course, most Hindi films are really vivid, but this was exceptional, I think. Really well done by Santosh Sivan.<br /><br />If you are not a veteran of Hindi films, then you may not fully appreciate this movie... You kinda have to be used to the subtitles, used to the music/dance sequences, and the basic formula that all Hindi films follow, in regards to romance. I mean, the story doesnt focus on Asoka's romantic life, but it does play an important role... Once you get past the first 15 minutes or so, the story really takes off. The story basically is how Prince Asoka rose to power to become King Asoka, and can happen when one is overcome with blind vengeance, despair and hatred...<br /><br />Shahrukh Khan (Asoka) has got to be by far, the best male Indian actor Ive seen, besides maybe Om Puri. He has great chemistry with Kareena Kapoor and overall, the movie is well-acted.<br /><br />Asoka is more reminiscent of Braveheart (excellent film), not Gladiator (terrible garbage), which the liner notes suggest. If there is a weak point, it might be the editing...alot of times, after a cut, I felt like there was too big a jump and a scene missing....<br /><br />Overall an A. I recommend it, especially if you are interested in Indian culture...its based on real events around 3rd century BC.",unsup

What I see as a film being interrupted by unnecessary music videos, they might see as the marriage of two vibrant, vital aspects of their culture.<br /><br />That said, Asoka is a film that I enjoyed very much. The story is epic, complex, and deeply layered, and it almost had me crying in the end (VERY few films can do this). The cast is fantastic, and they did an excellent job. The costumes and the sets were equally great. It's runtime is at 2 hours 45 minutes, but I was left hoping it was going to go a little bit longer. I wanted to know what happened to Davi, and I wanted to learn a few things from Asoka's latter days --when he embarked on his journey towards peace.<br /><br />This film is great, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.",unsup
11244_0,"Asoka is a movie by acclaimed cinematographer and director Santosh Sivan, and it is clearly evident from his latest venture that he is about to change the celluloid world forever. The movie is an epic and the first example of International Indian cinema on a wide scale, bigger canvas and projected through the eye of a master filmmaker.<br /><br />The film begins with the young Prince Asoka (Shah Rukh Khan) as a boy who watches his father accept Jainism, a peaceful religion that encourages him to toss aside his sword, which has caused much bloodshed. The young boy is intrigued by the weapon and picks up the new toy, masters it and soon learns that with the power of yielding this sword comes a great price. A warrior is born who fights many battles yet it is quickly established that this young man is very much fighting human wars, quenching a thirst for power and balancing this with his love for his family, particularly his mother. His mother renounces her son's violent ways and requests him to undergo the greatest education any person can: a journey.<br /><br />On his journey as an ordinary traveller, the prince encounters friends and learns to eat peasant food with his trusty horse Pawan, who mirroring an opposite reflection to Asoka's seemingly black heart, is pure white with eyes that steal the heart of anyone who gazes into them. While exploring through a forest he meets the Princess Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor), whose eyes mesmerise one moment and warn off invaders in a blink. She is the embodiment of beauty and the prince introduces himself as Pawan to her, only to find there is a price on her head and she, accompanied by General Bheema (Rahul Dev) and young Prince Arya (Suraj Balaji), are on their own journey to make it alive to Kalinga where their destiny awaits them.<br /><br />The journey of Asoka continues with trials and love, jealousy and betrayal, all making up cornerstones of what Prince Asoka experiences along the way. He falls flawlessly in love with Kaurwaki, and she becomes his soul and purpose of living, but destiny strikes a blow only to begin a mission born in rage and spread by blood. To reveal the rest of the movie would be taking too much from the audiences' viewing pleasure but the journey for Asoka is far from over.<br /><br />A story of a traveller's travels, his education that is the journey, the loves and losses and wars and redemption all encompass this 173 minute epic that grips the viewer from the moment the camera pans down onto Asoka, as if indicating it is descending onto a mountain full of riches within, up until the deeply disturbing ending, which leaves the viewer with a ray of hope before the credits flash to announce not the end of the story but the beginning.<br /><br />Santosh Sivan's camerawork and direction are par excellence, as his unique flash-technique and use of many shots to accentuate a minor detail in a scene all add together to create a cleverly woven story immortalised on film. In some sequences the camera cuts like a sword with flashes of residue left lingering both on screen and in the viewer's mind, yet in others following, he uses less shots and still manages to maintain rhythm. A film such as Asoka cannot be appreciated on a single viewing alone as upon initial contact one is simply bombarded with an onslaught of visual delights, spellbinding sounds and a story that emerges from our past but still reaches into the depths of every man's soul.<br /><br />Performance wise Shah Rukh Khan is the life of the movie. His acting prowess is detailed to the fullest in emotional gut-wrenching scenes, that portray innocence, rage, peace and longing all through his demeanour and eye-language. Asoka's arrogance and clarity of his every action, coupled with the consistent river of flowing energy is evident through the actor's performance which to his credit leaves one finding the line which ends with the character and turns into actor. Asoka could not only be Shah Rukh's greatest screen incarnation, but also a clear message to international cinema of his screen presence, dedication and mastery of his art.<br /><br />Kareena Kapoor, as the warrior princess who acts as sister and mother figure to Arya, a cautious then enduring lover to Asoka and emerges as someone on her own personal journey, in search of her identity and sense of belonging while juggling her duties, heart and mind in a three ring circus, Kareena gives what is by far her finest performance to date. After her innocent and natural debut in Refugee, she is finally allowed to once more realise her potential and play a character that only she could do justice to. Her look sans make up, except a few lines accentuating her eyes as the window to her soul, is as pure as the princess herself and the image of her going to get milk, fully wrapped except for her eyes is of sheer cinematic delight. Kareena has mastered the art of acting with her whole body in a short span of time and her performance in Asoka proves this. One hopes her potential is continually unlocked and her future holds many more performances and films of this calibre.<br /><br />It is ironical that a film inspired by history is destined to make history itself by being the first Indian masterpiece to be shown at so many festivals, in so many countries and shown nationwide breaking into mainstream British cinema. It is certainly one of Indian cinema's finest offerings and deserves the attention it is bound to receive, missing out on this homage to true cinematic form would be like missing history. Go see it.<br /><br />Fuad Omar.",unsup
11245_0,"While this engaging film wonderfully depicts the evolution of a young man into the ferocious killing machine emperor called ChandAshoka (Wild Ashoka) it pays little attention to the much more vital legacy as DharmAshoka (Faithful Ashoka). Cutting two songs, and adding another 10 minutes of exposition to show his evolution into the enlightened and compassionate meesenger of Buddhism would have made the film much more complete, and raised it to the level of highest achievement. Ashoka made Kalinga into a centre of Buddhism that endured more than a millennium, until the Shaivaite and Vaishnavite Hindu Renaissance of the 12th and 13th centuries. His legacy as a prophet of multiculturalism, peace and tolerance was insufficiently explored. It might have helped to have had an English translation of the beautiful and profound rock edicts that were shown only as a visual element in the opening and closing credits. It is a shame that Ashoka's Greek ancestry is not even acknowledged in the film. His grandfather Chandragupta, who is seen as convert to the ultra-pacifist Jain faith in the opening scenes, married the daughter of rht edfeated Greek general Seleucus Nicator, who led Alexander the Great's forces to defeat in the Punjab. Ashoka was born of one of Bindusara's Indian wives, which makes Ashoka at least one quarter Greek -- he was the very fusion of the Greco-Indian classical tradition, snd it was he who caused to be erected the collossal Buddhas at Bamiyan, destroyed earlier this year by the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Despite these minor failings it is a superb film, and even today you can wander the sand dunes of the River Daya (Compassion) in southeastern Orissa (formerly Kalinga) and experience the fullimagining of the Ashokan battlefield. Best regards Satya",unsup
11246_0,"This film is not intended to be derogatory towards Buddhists, but does indeed enact the historical beginnings of Buddhism. King Ashoka was a vicious warrior before he was shown the 8-fold path but his conversion did not occur until much blood was spilled in his land. It is unfortunate that other viewers have a skewed version of the conception of Buddhism and take this film to be negative. Nevertheless, I was impressed at the historical accuracy, the strength of the acting, and the vividness in the vision of the director. He chooses very unique positions to shoot the scenes and uses stop-time in very emotionally effective manners.

Maggie Cheung, Chingmy Yau, and Brigitte Lin are all fabulous, as is Ekin Cheng, Tony Leung Kar Fai and Jackie Cheung. Three sisters decide to get some temporary boyfriends when they think they have discovered their widower dad has terminal cancer with only a month to live.

Maggie Cheung is a naive, sweet optimist who accidentally picks a real lowlife very crude low-level sociopath gangster. She thinks he is great, and overlooks all his defects. Chingmy is the younger sexy sister who thinks she is picking a virgin. All three situations are insanely funny and combine for even more insanity when they all get together in the house to meet their dad. The Triad Olympics scene is especially funny- possibly a spoof of special Olympics.

11251_0,"There were some in the audience who couldn't believe that a film like Amos Gitai's Promised Land could be made, given its almost documentary like feel to an aged old problem of human trafficking for prostitution. I suppose those who feel that way would probably not take to London to Brighton, which like films such as Lilya-4-eva take an angle of child prostitution, and spun a different narrative out of it.<br /><br />Here, it's actually out of desperation - in fact almost all the characters here reek of it, in exploiting children on the streets and enticing them with significant sums of money in order to satisfy the whims of some rich clients. The film takes on a non-linear narrative in having its tale told, which leaves you pretty much engaged in wanting to find out just why two women are on the flight as per its title, leaving behind the city of London in double quick time, where we are introduced at 3:07am to Joanne (Georgia Groome) in thick makeup, being hidden in a stank toilet cubicle by an older lady of the streets, Kelly (Lorraine Stanley), suffering from one badly bruised eye.<br /><br />I suppose a modest production budget made this film look like a typical gritty English crime thriller, with the hand held camera bringing the audience into the thick of the action, either slowly drawing some sympathies from the lead female characters because of the lack of options made available to them, including being on the run, or presenting a sense of clear and present danger up close, especially when pimps Derek (Johnny Harris) and Chum (Nathan Constance) become inevitably close in catching up with the duo for an event they committed, kept closely under wraps.<br /><br />The relationship between Kelly and Joanne remain one of the highlights of the film, two women who have nobody else to turn to, trying to determine what their next course of action might be at every turn. We see how Kelly takes it upon herself as the surrogate guardian of Joanne, but I suppose only because of the immense guilt that she brought to the table, for having again out of desperation, introduce a young girl into her dark underworld. Those who have watched Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging would see how Georgia Groome makes an about turn from privileged child, to one roaming the streets.<br /><br />The other highlight which I had enjoyed was how thugs have the capability of systematically breaking down one's defenses, in balancing threats and carrots so as to gain some level of trust and obedience. Johnny Harris plays his role well as the pimp who constantly looks out for himself, of bowing to authority and pressure, while Nathan Constance as his chum actually had a lot more characterization going on for him instead. A pity though that it wasn't explored further, and had to be ended as it did in the film.<br /><br />London to Brighton has a sense of danger permeating throughout, in a sort of hunter versus prey kind of film, that will leave you on the edge of your seat as it builds up to its last act, in a story succinctly told in under 80 minutes.",unsup
11252_0,"A tough nugget of a film, grimy, gruesome but (amazingly) satisfying. London to Brighton is a faintly ironic title, recalling vintage cars rallies, bike races or simply a day out by the sea. The journey of Kelly and Joanne, conversely, is a desperate flight.<br /><br />The film isn't actually about the journey but bookended by it (if one were to be picky there is a lot of continuity issue here - two clearly different trains on the outward journey, train carriages that are almost a decade out of date - it's not the point). It's a film about the tart- who-discovers-her-heart, Kelly, played excellently by Lorraine Stanley, much of the time beneath a prosthetic shiner. Georgia Groome's Joanne is also impressive; Johnny Harris' loser pimp Derek is another super characterisation, a convincingly exponent of the emotional handbrake turn.<br /><br />The film's story is told briskly in a neatly orchestrated series of flashbacks. There's next to no extraneous incident, which means that Williams has to get the tone pretty right first time. With the possible exception of the mid close-ups of Stuart, the vengeful mobster driving the drama, which I didn't feel had quite the care they might have had, that comes to pass. 7/10",unsup

11254_0,"'London to Brighton' is a modern film, but has a peculiarly eighties feel to it. In the heyday of Thatcherism, an endless stream of radical film makers wanted to document the plight of the underclass. While Britain has become more affluent in the subsequent years, this does not mean that all social problems have disappeared; but except for films about the plight of immigrants, this sort of movie appears to have vanished as a genre. Perhaps this is one signal of Thatcherism triumph: that (usually middle class) film-makers are no longer interested in the plight of the poor. 'London to Brighton' is not just (or even mainly) a work of social compassion: it's a violent gangster thriller, but it takes place in a Britain best described as squalid. And one is struck at how unfashionable it seems to be to paint the country in such a light; and how commonplace it once was. Aside from these observations, the film is well acted, beautifully shot and and genuinely harrowing. But it takes place in a landscape almost devoid of hope. We don't know what made the characters into the people they are - and I found myself increasingly detached at the end, because of the clear impossibility of a happy ending. Indeed, I didn't know really what I was supposed to make of the fact that the eventual conclusion was not the worst imaginable. It's a short film, but although the initial premise is gripping, it eventually suffers from the absence of wider context - ""girl goes home"" is a less powerful ending to a story if we have no idea of why she went away.

11255_0,"In 2001, Dr. Richard Estes and Dr. Neil Alan Weiner estimated that there are one million child prostitutes in the world and the average age of entry into prostitution is between 11 and 13. This disturbing subject has been largely ignored by the movies, with the exception of Lilya-4-Ever and Paul Williams' London to Brighton. Containing stellar performances by Lorraine Stanley as Kelly, a street-smart prostitute, and Georgia Groome as Joanne, an 11-year-old runaway, London to Brighton is a low budget but gritty, uncompromising thriller that dramatizes the lives of two young prostitutes, the predators who prey on them, and the criminal underworld of British society.<br /><br />Though it is sometimes hard to watch because of the graphic violence, the film conveys a sense of humanity that shines through the despair. As London to Brighton begins, two hysterical young girls hide in a public toilet in London's Victoria Station in the middle of the night The younger girl, possibly only 11 or 12, her face smeared with lipstick and bruises, cries copious tears while the older, chubbier girl tries to comfort her though her own face is a mass of welts and black and blue marks. Both girls are hiding from their pimp Derek (Johnny Harris) and his client Stuart Allen (Sam Spruell) after a botched job in which the client's father, Duncan Allen (Alexander Morton) died in the client's apartment.<br /><br />It began when Kelly, on orders from Derek, went scouting for an underage girl to match the needs of his wealthy client. Now on the run, Kelly leaves Joanne in the rest room while she does some ""work"" to obtain money to visit a safe house in Brighton. The film unfolds in a non-linear fashion and we gradually learn the sordid details in flashbacks. As the girls head to Brighton to take cover, Derek and his cohort Chum (Nathan Constance), forced to take action against the girls before they have to pay the price themselves, are determined to track them down.<br /><br />Recently released on a subtitled DVD that includes a commentary by the director and others, an alternate ending, and eight deleted scenes, London to Brighton packs a wallop. Energy and tension adorn the film from start to finish, a span of only 85 minutes. Though some of the scenes indicate a sense of lost hope, in the courage and loving protectiveness of Kelly and the childlike innocence of Joanne, there is also a sense of possibility. Winner of the Best New Director Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival with a style reminiscent of the raw immediacy of Shane Meadows and the social awareness of Ken Loach, Paul Williams in London to Brighton has delivered an outstanding first feature.",unsup

It is a low budget film about some very unlikeable people, the sort nearly all of us would not bother with or would want know. They all are brutal & foul mouthed.<br /><br />However we do care, to some degree for them.<br /><br />The cast are mostly newcomers or featured players from TV) I never heard of any of them). I definitely want to see them in other films. Lorraine Stanley plays a working street girl. Georgia Groome (all of 14 when film was made) is new to the streets.Johnny Downs is the evil pimp, & Sam Spruell as the sadistic son of a client. They & the others in cast do fine jobs as these unsavory person.<br /><br />Normally I stay far from this type of film,BUT this time I was mesmerized, The hand held camera work was not as annoying as it usually is & most of my readers know I eschew foul language.

For me, this film seemed to paint itself into a corner as it got towards the end. Once we got to the scene in the field, at the end, we knew that he wasn't going to shoot Joanne, because of the heart-to-heart they'd had in the car. We also suspected that he wasn't going to shoot Kelly, if only because she'd been so sympathetically portrayed throughout. So we assume that he's going to shoot the pimp (because he'd been portrayed as thoroughly unsympathetic throughout). Which he does. Ho hum. At this point I was thinking ""please don't cut to a shot of the girls on the train to Devon"". Which he did. I really wanted to like this film, and I did at first, but then the story didn't seem to know what to do with itself, and couldn't find an ending to live up to its beginnings.

Kelly makes friends with Joanne and takes her to Duncan's mansion. When Joanne cries in the bedroom where she is with Duncan, Kelly runs and helps the girl. At 3:07 AM, a bruised Kelly and the tearful Joanne lock themselves in a public toilet. Kelly asks Joanne to stay there because she will raise some money for them to travel to Brighton. Meanwhile, Duncan's son Stuart Allen calls Derek and asks him to meet him in a night-club. When Derek arrives at the nightclub, Derek calls his friend Chum and they begin to chase the girls.

11259_0,"London to Brighton is a superb slice of British crime pulp; a no nonsense, down and dirty tale of two relatively weak individuals, given the parameters of the genre, desperate to get away from the lifestyle they've grim-and-bared up until this point. Systematically, one particular character must balance evading capture with the taking on of the moral responsibilities that come with looking after a much younger individual they've unwittingly roped into this world by way of child-prostitution. If there is a distinct shrill ringing throughout us as the film plays out, it's because while conforming to gangster genre conventions, we see most of the world and most of the film unfold through the eyes and ultimately with two females: a very young girl and a middle aged woman, two people we feel are under threat and will have harm come to them if they're caught. This is in stark contrast to usual crime film fare; in which crime infused males can be on the run, or can owe a debt, or whatever  but do not necessarily carry the same vulnerability. Thus, London to Brighton, with its scuzzy and raw feel, comes across as scarier; more frightening in its depiction of a world, the characters within and overall attention to genre.<br /><br />The girls on the run are twelve year old Joanne (Groome) and the much elder Kelly (Stanley), a prostitute. They're played by two actresses more familiar to televisual work and as low-down supporting roles in feature films, but here are given the chance to shine in lead roles, snapping up the opportunity in the process. Their predicament is a set up that can be pitched in little to no words, immediately getting across a sense of urgency. The film begins with the two in a public toilet; panic-stricken and acting in nervous manner; something's gone wrong and they're about to go on the run from a London based crime syndicate as those connected to the organisation chase them.<br /><br />The film gets across a sense of the sort of danger they're in without ever really showing anything, instead opting for the talk of an off screen event or individual. On this occasion, the talk of potentially of going to prison for what it is they've done is most prominent an item of which plants seeds of great worry in our minds as we observe these relatively hapless, physically out of breath with their clothes torn and clearly in a bad shape, people stumble through the seamy, low-level based locations they inhabit. The introduction of Derek (Harris), Kelly's pimp, and the potential threat that he carries as a character is only brought into perspective when it is revealed he answers further still to an individual higher up than he is; the son of the leader of this organisation. Where Derek is more extroverted and animated; Stuart (Spruell), the higher up, is calmer, dresses more formally and talks in a quieter manner which quickly pushes the boundaries out further as to whom acts as more of a threat, without taking away any of the initial menace Derek inhabits. This minute, but observed ploy, captures the film's tone of getting in deeper; of assuming something to be of a specific nature but then having to recognise a new threat, or new predicament, which furthers feelings and emotions.<br /><br />As an event which spawns the mess everyone finds themselves in, it is revealed that Joanne is a runaway wondering the streets of London, and is quickly picked up by both Derek and Kelly when it is made apparent a local crime boss, Stuart's father, wants a younger girl to feed some depraved sexual cravings. Joanne carries with her a mouth, an ability to small talk her way through conversations with adults that we truly feel she might actually possess. The locale in which she is required for whatever perverted plans are in store for her is presented by way of brilliant, white light; a blinding light that reflects off of seemingly marble walls; floors and white pillars dotted around the room. The mise-en-scene and colour gives it a disturbing sense of resembling ancient Rome, specifically in appearance; in all its rich, beautiful, robe-decked in-glory. The sheer contrast of locales between what we're presented through the cities of London and Brighton, the latter of which itself looked like a sunny; beach-housing; amusements displaying safe haven compared to London, is stark, disorientating and disturbing.<br /><br />The film really is fine feature debut, amongst the best of last decade and sits alongside works such as Donnie Darko; One Hour Photo and Memento. There's a real sense of terror in London to Brighton; an immediacy which you feel is born out of the two female leads and their place in the film working within a genre which would usually, in terms of Kelly's role as a prostitute, see them relegated to a nothing supporting role or to act as mere eye candy. Its willingness to have its women act in an independent and strong manner sees them break away from orders in a very male dominated world, that of crime, and renders them characters whom have limits; morals and know that when the line is to be drawn, it must be drawn, no matter what the consequence or whom one is dealing with. London to Brighton forms an exciting passage of film-making out of a relatively routine idea, with guided attention toward mostly all of the characters, Stuart of which goes through his own series of frightening changes later on; awareness of how the film should 'look' at very specific points and gets the best out of a low-key cast.

Despite the best efforts of Graham Greene to sound an alarm 60 years ago to the true nature of Brighton, the writer of this film seemed content to depict it as a sleepy whole night's journey (it's only an hour from Victoria) where someone who knows where to get ""business"" can spend the day snoozing on a couch with no fear of molestation, especially not from those ruffians from London (despite fact that the Brighton flat exterior scenes where clearly filmed in the uniquely brown bricked setting of London).<br /><br />The acting was superb and I never doubted the performance of any of the leads, or even the direction, my problems are with the plot and production. It's just if you're going to call the thing London to Brighton I would have suggested some research on part 2 of your title, I was even a little doubtful of the first part.<br /><br />I was left feeling that the writer had written a film for the sake of it. I was wondering what he'd written it for? I felt it was a middle class orgy of how unpleasant the working class can be.<br /><br />Distracting flaws: **POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW** If you wanted someone to bring someone to you in 24 hours, would you really inflict a potentially fatal leg wound?<br /><br />Very anal but: They jump on a slam door train and we see a shot of a replacement more modern sliding door Thameslink (*stoat alert - they don't actually run from Victoria) making its way down the line.<br /><br />Why, if they were coming from the station would they arrive on the bus from Roedean?<br /><br />If you were on the run wouldn't you turn your phone off if not throw it away? Instead it's left in the flat for someone to answer and give precise directions of where they are. We're not even sure what the relatives do... oh yeah it's Brighton.. no one has to do anything there!<br /><br />As mentioned before, anyone who's been to London would know that Kelly's relative's flat was clearly in London, and couldn't have been anywhere else!<br /><br />It seemed a very Dickensian ending that the young girl who ""shouldn't be there"" gets enough cash to make it to Devon. Where as the ""Tart with the Heart"" leaves Devon and goes back to London to go back on the game... ""Well that's all she'd know isn't it!"" ;-><br /><br />Very disappointing but indicative of too much cash going to the wrong people for poorly realised ideas.",unsup
11262_0,"I saw London to Brighton recently on DVD and I just had to voice my opinion. It really is one of the most exciting films I've seen for a long time. It's gritty, hard-hitting and never dull. Not only does London to Brighton triumph as a great British film but also as a gripping thriller, and one of which I can safely say new comer Paul Andrew Williams should be proud.<br /><br />London to Brighton tells the tale of young runaway Joanne and prostitute Kelly who's lives collide and consequently take a turn for the worst. The film is told mainly within flashback sequences that slowly reveal the sinister reasons for Joanne and Kelly's hasty departure to normally colourful Brighton (this film couldn't be further from that happy seaside town). It all starts when Kelly's pimp Derek asks her to locate a young girl for one of his clients; Kelly refuses at first but eventually gives in. It doesn't take long her to locate hard talking 11 year old Joanne wondering the streets of London. The two then visit the house of Derek's wealthy and well-connected client, the result of which forces the pair to flee London in fear of being perused by Derek and is mob of amateur gangsters.<br /><br />At times it really is quite a painful film to watch. The very idea of prostituting a girl that young is sickening yet 13 year old Georgia Groome stands alone as the disillusioned runaway. Her portrayal of a homeless child ushered into prostitution is particularly hard hitting and often heart breaking. One scene I found particularly shocking sees Kelly, Joanne and Derek in a greasy spoons café; Joanne is awkwardly smoking and acting tough though it is clear she is out of her depth. The setting itself is grim but it was the conversation that made me squirm, asking a young girl not yet a teenager weather she is virgin is or is not a virgin made tense uncomfortable viewing, her innocents shining through by the fact she appeared to be unaware of what was being said.<br /><br />I was amazed at the films tiny budget; Paul Andrew Williams is definitely a gifted director to produce something so gripping with such little money. I even heard he gave out minor parts in film to friends in exchange for the use of their cars.<br /><br />All in all this is defiantly a step in right direction for British film. Hopefully with films like this, Red Road (Andrea Arnold, 2006, another I recommend) and home-grown talent such as Shane Meadows we can prove we Brits are not all about predictable romantic comedies and Jane Austin adaptations.",unsup
11263_0,"A prostitute and a young girl on the run, that's the basic set-up here. But who exactly are they running from and why? Well, these two things are explained rather quickly for us before details are revealed that start to make the whole thing more intriguing, complex and a little bit different from the gamut of British crime movies that we've seen since the turn of the century.<br /><br />I don't want to, even accidentally, reveal any more about the plot or details that add to the well-paced story so I will just compliment the acting, look of the movie and soundtrack before leaving you with some random thoughts on the essence of the film. Every part of this film oozes quality, the two main female leads are excellent and the males are more than just stereotypical tricks/pimps/gangsters/etc. The movie looks suitably ""everyday"" and yet not ugly despite the subject matter. And the soundtrack is superb, with a definite highlight being the use of ""Moonlight Sonata"" in a scene that will forever meld itself audio/visually in my memory thanks to the expert execution.<br /><br />Finally, I'd just like to add my general thoughts on the essence of the film and how it rises above it's individual scenes of bleakness and pain to become something rather . . . . hopeful. The whole movie comes together in a way that shows, to sound cheesy, that there is even light in the darkest of dark places. Even a muddy puddle will quench the thirst of the most desperate human. I don't want to sound pretentious or to seem as if I saw something that wasn't really there but that previous sentence just popped into my head immediately after viewing this film.

We are but onlookers, knowing that all that unfolds in front of us will not be terribly savory. But as the story unfolds we grow to like both the key characters because they have been forced into their predicament, and while they will be helpless for much of their plight their spirit will hold and eventually ring true.

11265_0,"London to Brighton is a grim crime film that rolls back the glamorisation of gangsters in Guy Ritchie film and prostitution in Secret Diaries of a Call Girl.<br /><br />The focus of London to Brighton is on Joanna (Georgia Groome) an 12-year-old runaway and Kelly (Lorraine Stanley), a prostitute. Both are on the run after killing a gangster and his son Stuart (Sam Spruell) is out for revenge. Joanna and Kelly run off to Brighton and Stuart demands that their pimp Derek (Johnny Harris) find them and contact him as soon as he does. Whilst in Brighton Joanna gets a chance to be child again but Kelly has to raise money and does it the only way she can, selling herself. As well Joanna and Kelly becomes stronger as the film continues.<br /><br />This film looks at dark themes such as prostitution and paedophilia. The film was well handled by the first time writer/director Paul Andrew Williams. He shows that he has talent and a bright future ahead of him. The acting was of a high standard especially from Georgia Groome who also has a promising career ahead of her. In the film there are characters that you actually care about and you want to know what happens to them. There was a subtle use of music and the direction was strong, using the techniques of social realism. The only criticism is that I think is that I more could been found out about Kelly's and Derek's pasts.<br /><br />London to Brighton is a grim view, but a worthy film.",unsup
11266_0,"Films like this make me cheer, because it is rare that a film aims so high and hits all of its marks. I mean to compliment not only the writer/directory Paul Andrew Williams's sure-shot storytelling, but the outstanding performances all around.<br /><br />This is a deeply unpleasant film, by which I mean it deals in dark subject matter. It is difficult to watch. But I cannot remember watching actors work harder to earn their paychecks, especially the two protagonists played by the incredible Lorraine Stanley and the young Georgia Groome, whose terrified sobbing just absolutely tore me apart.<br /><br />Watching Lorraine Stanley carry both guilt and responsibility (especially her scene as she sits listening on the couch), I was struck by what exactly how difficult acting must be. I rewound to watch this scene twice, amazed with the overwhelming realism of her reaction to what was going on. Neither overblown nor self-consciously minimalist, I could simply not imagine this character reacting any other way; not even by a hair. Watching an actor hit their mark so precisely, it reminded me of everything I could never pull off myself in front of a camera, and why I never sought to be an actor: I know that even after years of study and practice, I would not be capable of this kind of precision. This actress walks around the whole film with a beat up face and her basic humanity just bores straight through the latex and makeup in a way that never leaves you guessing exactly what's going on in her mind. She's just fantastic.<br /><br />And I don't want to leave out the bad guys. Sometimes they don't get the credit they deserve because we love to hate them, but without them, you can't pull as hard for the good guys as you would, and Johnny Harris in particular pulls off the sleazy, evil, slightly thick Derek with remarkable effectiveness, wearing the characters immorality on his shirtsleeve and fairly stinking up the joint in the best possible way. Ditto for the rest of the baddies, for whom you will have, I promise, no sympathy whatsoever.<br /><br />After watching a terrible big-budget film with A-list Hollywood types early in the evening, I cannot help but focus on the contrast between punching a clock in a big budget film and putting sweat and blood into a labor of love that London to Brighton must have been.<br /><br />There is a vast difference - and it is clear from some of the comments here that many cannot make the distinction - between making a depraved film, and making a film about a depraved subject. This film is certainly the latter. At no point in this film are we invited to sympathize with the degenerate villains, and our sympathies for Kelly and Joanne simply grow as we become more and more acquainted with the malevolence and motivations of the reprehensible and sometimes demented antagonists.<br /><br />This will be worth your time, and I'd definitely rate it higher than the 7.1 it is currently at on IMDb. This is an outstanding film and, unpleasant and squicky subject matter aside, I recommend it unreservedly.<br /><br />Deft, effective film-making. This is how it's done, folks.",unsup
11267_0,"Perhaps because no American director today could conceivably do anything so lean and mean as Paul Andrew Williams' 2006 feature, US critics have been quite insensitive to what in 2006 a Guardian critic called ""the British film of the year."" I guess we just don't get it. Most American reviews say this is technically skillful, ""but."" and then dismiss Williams' 'London to Brighton' as repugnant, morally questionable, its ending soft. ""But at the end of the day, pic has a so-what feel -- fine technique in the service of something rather unsavory,"" writes 'Variety's' usually perceptive Derek Elley. Ugly material, yes; but ""in the service"" of ithow so? In fact, the gangster son of his pedophile father commits an act of kindness, in his way, in those final scenes, which are full of horror and terror. Even granted this general dismissal of the value of an admittedly accomplished debut, the US online website Metacritic's estimated rating of American reviews of London to Brighton, 56, is another erroneous Stateside assessment. English reviews were understandably glowing. American ones were niggardly, but not that much.<br /><br />The film explodes into action from the first frame with Kelly (Lorraine Stanley) and Joanne (Georgia Groome) bursting into a ladies' room where Kelly hides Joanne in a toilet. They're a thirty-something whore with bruises and an inflamed black eye and a frightened runaway not yet twelve with melting makeup whom Kelly found at Waterloo Station for her spineless pimp Derek (Johnny Harris), to please a pedophile gangster named Duncan Allen (Alexander Morton). The man came to grief and his cold-eyed son Stuart (Sam Spruell) comes to exact revenge; but we find this out later. All we know is these hapless females are in danger and have to get out of London. Kelly leaves Joanne in the toilet while she scores tricks to raise money for train tickets to Brighton. On the trip the pair are pitifully delighted to be in the country (""a bit of color""), and Kelly runs down to the beach, plays a game to win stuffed toys at the sparsely populated luna park. But Kelly's friends in Brighton are as unsavory as Derek and his pals and don't look much different, and a stupid mistake with a mobile phone leads to their discovery.<br /><br />As these simple intensely photographed events unfold flashbacks tell what led up to them. 'London to Brighton' is as well edited as it is acted, and the storytelling is seamless and clear. The nastiness is intense, but not rubbed in your face. Most of it is sensed but not seen. Stuart Allen cuts Derek's leg in a car with a straight razor when he sends him off to find the girls and Derek limps from then on, but we don't see the cutting. His father tied up Joanne and she screamed, but we don't see the tying. The writing is economical. Spruell has only a couple of scenes, and his father (Morton) is barely more than glimpsed, but their lines aren't easy to forget. Cigarettes are a theme. Everyone is begging them and smoking them, and in the climax Stuart tells Joanne how his father stopped him from smoking as a boy by making him eat a pack of cigarettes, even the foil wrapping and the filters, when he caught him with a lit one. The Coen brothers might envy the grim revenge scene, but it's less playful and faster than anything they might do. There's conventional music at certain points to heighten drama and suspense, but it's not intrusive and it works. An English rap song at the end credits is grimly articulate and revealing.<br /><br />'London to Brighton' shows huge promise and revives the British gangster genre, lifting it out of its slough of cuteness and mannerism. Martin McDonagh might need to have a look.<br /><br />In what seems likely to be very limited release, Williams' 'London to Brighton' was shown at Cinema Village in New York from February 8 2008.

I genuinely cared about the outcome for the two main characters and I felt ashamed of my fellow humans at the more uncomfortable scenes.

11269_0,"London to Brighton (2006)<br /><br />A harrowing story, a real descent into a little sliver of the streetwalking underworld of London and the perils of little rich girls who run away from home. I don't mean to make light of any of it--the movie pulls no punches, and adds some that go beyond the usual violence, too--but this is one of those recent stories where a terrible situation is imagined, and then filmed with awful realism. The two tracks, the plot with its significance, and the raw, visceral reaction to seeing anything so horrible, are both played out to the max. And acting is really first rate. The bad guys are really sneeringly awful, and the two key females, a full grown but struggling prostitute and a young girl who gets swept up in it all, are so believable it's scary. And impressive.<br /><br />And none of this is enough for a great movie. It makes for an intense experience, and there's no rule that says a movie has to be enjoyable (this is totally not enjoyable in the usual sense). But there is little here that reveals or probes, there is little of what you might call art, or nuance, or originality. It's not exactly a formula, yet, this kind of abuse in your living room, but I think it will be. There are several I've seen recently, the one that comes to mind is Julia. In both movies, young children are victims and it's difficult to really watch without detaching and looking around the living room and reminding yourself this is fiction, these are actors, don't worry.<br /><br />Terrible things happen in the world, of course, and worse things. But I'm not sure we need to see them, or should want to. It's like becoming an emergency room doctor because you are fascinated with suffering and blood. Movies should be like doctors, then (to stretch the metaphor) and have some purpose to them beyond wallowing. <br /><br />And beyond representation. Maybe it's a reminder of the truth out there, but if that's all, it's not enough, and it goes on a very long time. I think accurate representation is the simple motive behind the filming. The director (in this case with a short resume--I've never heard of him) makes it vivid, fast, and very real. In that sense he succeeded. But again, realism isn't really a great goal in itself. It can be a means to a greater effect, a higher (or if not higher, at least other, separate) intention, something that takes the viewer somewhere. Anywhere.",unsup

11270_0,"Britain from time to time produces brilliantly realistic urban films, and here in Paul Andrew Wiliams' debut feature we have a truly great genre entry that is awash with realism.<br /><br />Joanne is a 12 year old runaway befriended by young prostitute Kelly, a tragic event leads to them fleeing from London to Brighton on the train, in furious pursuit is a pimp and a gangsters son, and all of their lives are hurtling towards a night of reckoning.<br /><br />This film contains prostitutes, paedophiles, drugs, and violence, yet to even think that this film panders to genre stereotypes would be doing it an injustice. This is a gritty realistic picture that thru its bleak story telling manages to make the viewer feel a part of the events unfolding, it's harsh and unrelenting in its portrayal of the dark parts of city life that do exist in our world. The screenplay is as lean as a prize featherweight boxer, no saggy tag ons, no sub plots to bog the story down, just a hard as nails story culminating in a wonderful final reel.<br /><br />Lorraine Stanley, Georgia Groome, Johnny Harris, and Sam Pruell, your names, I hope, will get to be known outside of England, because you all excellently realised characters that reminded me of people I have encountered during my life. I do hope that you will not be consigned to the forgotten filing cabinet that contains the one film wonders. <br /><br />Excellent and unforgettable picture 9/10",unsup

It's nearly impossible to make it good on as tight a budget as this was obviously shot on. The fact that it was made in such a short time is also another factor to be considered. And my consideration, after taking all these factors in to account is, this is brilliant! It is a strong story with plenty of moral interest, it has strong performances and a nicely done twist. I wish Paul every success with whatever he does next! He is a directing and writing talent to watch out for!",unsup

What I was expecting was some amateurish first film effort which I hoped would have enough good ideas to make it worth a full viewing; what I got instead was a minor masterpiece of cinema. I cannot remember the last time I saw a British film with such story-telling verve. It's amazing to think that this is a first feature from writer\director Paul Andrew Williams, made on a nothing budget. I can't wait to see what he produces in the years to come.<br /><br />The unfolding of the story is masterfully done. The small details of character interaction are incredibly well observed.

11273_0,"In London, the pimp Derek (Johnny Harris) assigns the prostitute Kelly (Lorraine Stanley) that works for him to find a young girl on the streets to escort the powerful mobster Duncan Allen (Alexander Morton). Kelly finds the twelve year-old runaway Joanne (Georgia Groome) in the train station and Derek proposes one hundred pounds for the service and the girl accepts. Kelly befriends Joanne and takes her to Duncan's mansion. When Joanne cries in the bedroom where she is with Duncan, Kelly runs and defends the girl. At 3:07 AM, the bruised Kelly and the tearful Joanne lock themselves in a public toilet. Kelly asks Joanne to stay there because she will raise some money for them to travel to Brighton. Meanwhile, Duncan's son Stuart Allen (Sam Spruell) calls Derek and asks him to meet him in a night-club. When Derek arrives, Stuart tells that his father is dead and he wants the responsible; further, he cuts his knee sinew to prove that he is not kidding. Derek calls his associate Chum (Nathan Constance) and they begin to chase the girls.<br /><br />The excellent ""London to Brighton"" has a magnificent screenplay that discloses a crude and dark tale of friendship and lost of innocence through flashbacks and a surprising conclusion. This low-budget gem has a stunning cast, with top-notch performances, and the debut of director (and writer) Paul Andrew Williams in a feature could not be better. In the DVD, there is an awesome and cruel alternative ending that should not be deleted, as well the sequence in Duncan's bedroom with the two girls. The comradeship of Kelly and Joanne and the final redemption of Kelly protecting the girl are touching and beautiful. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Londres Proibida"" (""Forbidden London"")",unsup
11274_0,"The plot of London to Brighton is simple, the budget minimal, the actors and writer/director unknown. But the result is an unexpectedly captivating movie.<br /><br />London to Brighton follows a prostitute and a young run-away as they flee from their recent past: From London to Brighton, no less. Through a well-balanced series of flashbacks, we gradually learn how they came to be running. The movie's tension slowly builds as those who are chasing them draw closer. The premise isn't revolutionary, but the delivery is robust. Half the characters spend half the time not knowing what is happening around them. Like the best thrillers, there is still enough to keep the audience guessing right to the end.<br /><br />The movie is underscored by a very British portrayal of urban mob violence - gritty and selectively brutal, with language to match. The characters are explored just enough to give the movie some depth.<br /><br />The issues contained within the movie are morally challenging. While there is little explicit sexual content, the mere context will be enough to make some viewers uncomfortable. It would be easy to impose ""middle-class"" morality, but fortunately that doesn't happen. Instead the characters react only at the extremes: The prostitute with misgivings about sex involving very young children; not the prostitute with misgivings about prostitution.<br /><br />London to Brighton is notable because it places a 13 year old actor in one of the leading roles. The performance is raw and the look of innocence genuine. Yet she portrays events and emotions that she can have no experience of with disturbing competence. To paraphrase the director, ""she certainly won't be allowed to see the film when it released in the cinema"".<br /><br />The movie is rough round the edges. It drags in places. Sometimes the acting doesn't quite convey all the emotions it could do. It is easy to find fault in the detail. But overall London to Brighton is an impressive first feature by 'Paul Andrew Williams' and most of the cast.",unsup
11275_0,"From the opening scene I was utterly gripped by this movie, and the sense of menace never let up. I damn well cared what happened to the 2 female leads, and I came within an inch of turning away from the screen through sheer tension. The (under)acting was first-rate in my opinion and utterly believable, the direction assured, and the editing perhaps the ultimate triumph, with expert use of flashbacks to slowly reveal the horror and sleaze. Made on a shoestring budget and within a tight time-frame, these factors only seem to add to the rough and ready quality of this film. I staggered out feeling relieved it was over, but also strangely uplifted, and greatly rewarded for my £6.50 investment. Only 2 scenes seemed a little contrived in order to keep the continuity going, but the twist near the end was clever and resonant. On a par with 'My Name is Joe' and 'Trainspotting'. Oh yes, and my flat in Brighton (from a distance) is in one of the scenes :)",unsup
11276_0,"Being hailed by some as 'the best British film of the century' (Big Issue) and 'British cinema at its best' (The Scotsman) and on the back of several prestigious film award from festivals around the world 'London to Brighton' has a lot to live up to. It doesn't disappoint, dark, violent, gritty and bleak this is what Mike Leigh would be like if he did 18 certificate films with Shane Meadows as his assistant. From the opening sequence of the two main characters bursting battered and bruised into a public toilet it grips like a hand round the throat and only lets up to become uncomfortable, it is certainly an assault on the senses and sensibilities of the cinema audience who take this brutal journey along with the characters on screen. Shot on a relatively low budget but managing to not seem so, the films main tricks are in the editing, jump cuts and flashbacks only adding to the suspense as you begin to piece together the whole sordid story. With some superb acting from the cast, especially Joanne who portrays her vulnerability like Toby Kebbell did in 'Dead Mans Shoes', and a suitably dirty soundtrack the whole thing feels very British. It has the grainy look of 'Get Carter' mixed with the grey of any Ken Loach, the backdrops of dirty streets and dirtier walls only make scenes like the two polystyrene cups blowing in the wind (reminiscent of the carrier bag in 'American Beauty') all the more beautiful. There are of course other nods like a shot that lingers on a doorway for ages instead of showing us what's happening inside which reminded me of a similar shot in Hitchcock's film 'Frenzy'. Although not an easy watch it manages to balance the bloody with the beautiful, the violence with the unlikely friendship between the two main female leads and triumphs just as everyone says as one of the best British thrillers of recent years. London to Brighton deserves to be a huge hit, its bold, its brilliant and its British and it proves once again that we have a thriving film industry packed full of talented people that can still give Hollywood a run for it's money.",unsup

Wining awards at both Edinburgh and rain dance can't be a bad sign. For a first time director Paul Andrew Williams pulls off a very confident film, it can be quite hard hitting, very well written with some really good performances. The two central characters particularly shine in the darker moments in the film, the combination of there acting and the directors ability to create such a tangible atmosphere creates some truly gripping scenes. In short Its the kind of film the British film industry should be making more of, challenging, entertaining and decidedly British and hopefully it will get a large release. Highly Recommend!!",unsup
11278_0,"The fact that the Edinburgh International Film Festival bestowed their New Director award on Paul Andrew Williams is a solid enough indicator of the strengths and unique qualities of London TO BRIGHTON. Admittedly made on a shoe-string budget, and cast with relative unknowns, the film never once looks cheap or out of its depth. I was amazed when I saw it at Edinburgh by just how tough and unflinching a portrayal of the criminal underworld it is. The leads put in tremendous performances that will surprise many, and William's writing is exceptional. The film really zips along through its 90min length, and pulls the viewer in to a lock-tight embrace. In my opinion this film is one of the highlights of the year so far and a real find for the British film industry. For a first-time director working on a tiny budget, getting five star reviews in the Guarduan and Scotsman, and great praise from the Times is a hell of an achievement.

Life is hard and hopeless for these people. They have few choices open to them. Their environment is sordid and gloomy. Even the seaside resort of Brighton is cold, windy and desolate.<br /><br />But what lifts the audience out of what might otherwise be a depressing experience is the storyline which builds excitement and fear to the point where my friend felt he had to get up and actually leave the auditorium!

11280_0,"In a run-down public toilet in London at 3.07 am, the middle-aged prostitute Kelly takes on the 11-year-old runaway Joanne. Together they take the train from London to Brighton to escape Kelly's hard-edged pimp. The film explores the mother-daughter-like bond that forms between the girls as they are left to fend for themselves in the gritty underworld of South London.<br /><br />Paul Andrew Williams has done something remarkably cool here that he did not realise until his film started receiving praise and wider distribution (it even made its way to the Stockholm International Film Festival, where I saw it). Nevertheless, we can easily tell that this is a quality film with excellent performances by its two leads Lorraine Stanley and young Georgia Groome. Although the seedy underground and hierarchies of bad guys, johns and pimps channel Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn, director Williamsm stresses that London to Brighton is ""not a gangster movie"", but an unflinching look at the two aforementioned characters and how they cope under pressure.<br /><br />The plot is left best unspoiled because it is gradually unfolded through well-positioned flashbacks, arguably the goldmine of the film. The first half of the film has a few pacing problems as nothing truly jumps out and grabs you  but when the unspeakably effective background segments are interjected London to Brighton receives a well-deserved jumpstarting kick up the arse, continuing down a perfectly-paced path. One of the most poignant scenes sees Kelly's pimp ask 11-year-old Joanne if she is a virgin, and subsequently telling her to have sex with an older man. The amount of smoking, cursing, screaming and beating that goes on around her is heartbreaking.<br /><br />This would not be the case with a lesser actress. The fact is that Georgia Groome inhabits Joanne so effortlessly and deeply that it is a sight to behold. Her crying performances wrenches your heart. Other than the perfectly-cast Groome, the director told us that he applied no seriousness to finding the 'perfect people' for the respective characters: the guy in the green jeep, for example, was cast because ""he had a green jeep"". In this way a gritty, unpleasant and plain cast presents itself  an ordinary pack of South London criminals. Better yet, they truly emote. When Kelly and Joanne down the sour rum & coke that the older man has given them, you can feel the bitter aftertaste of the drink.<br /><br />'London to Brighton' has been likened to Mike Leigh's Naked, and perhaps this is an apt comparison. What remains clear, however, is that Williams has served up a deliciously gritty and unflinching drama in the midst of chaos, which he occasionally pauses with wonderful slow-motion captures and dreamy shots of the windy barren boardwalk of Brighton. It's bruised, realistic, harrowing and compelling  a very good watch.<br /><br />8 out of 10",unsup

Maybe I am biased because my favorite actor is in this movie, but let's face it, this is a role that was practically custom-made for him to play, and the supporting cast (Twinkle Khanna and Johnny Lever) have great chemistry with him.<br /><br />Baadshah is a wonderful mix of comedy and drama, and is good for lighthearted fun, although the plot becomes rather fast-paced nearing the end of the movie and some may find it hard to keep up (although I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I had to read the subtitles, and I followed it fine, so.......) The songs are pretty good, one of my favorites being ""Woh Ladki Jo Sab Se"", the scene in which Raj- ""Baadshah"" (Shah Rukh Khan) first starts his job to con Seema (Twinkle Khanna). The movie also plastered with comedic slapstick-type scenes,strongly represented in the scenes where Baadshah upturns his house to convince Seema that he is blind.

11286_0,"Shahrukh Khan has to be a versatile actor. He played a young man married to a ""widow"" in Deewana, an understanding adopted son in Pardes, or a rich NRI kid who still knows his roots in DDLJ. He also played a man who has to choose between money and ""the"" girl in Yes Boss, two OPPOSITE identical people in Duplicate, a man in love with a terrorist in Dil Se..., a man seeking revenge for his father in Baazigar, or widow whose heart yearns for an engaged girl in KKHH. This role is nothing like those past roles. Now he plays a James Bond wannabe who gets stuck in a mission that affects the girl he loves. This role may not be anywhere near the roles I mentioned, but he highly impresses. The movie is complicated, but it is also interesting and it keeps your head up. The movie could have done without comedy, but knowing this is a Shahrukh Khan movie, there is always room for jello; I mean comedy. The movie has it's number of clichés, but in a way helps the movie (if you know what I mean). Though one thing I should mention, Twinkle Khanna may resemble Raveena Tandon, she is totally unfit for Shahrukh. But Twinkle Khanna definitely makes her present felt and I can't really see another actress for this role. Amrish Puri was not bad, but he looked to old when fighting with Shahrukh. Raakhee impresses in her first scene, but after-wards she looses her place in the movie. Deepak Tjori was good as he should have been the lead villain though Deepshika was completely out of place and deserves better roles. The songs were excellent. The title song was a sadly unnoticed song because it's awesomely presented. Woh Ladki Jo (That Girl Who) luckily got some recognition being the HIT song.

11288_0,"Only a complete curmudgeon could dislike this film. It's a brilliant slapstick parody of the spy/private eye genres with the Baadshah of Bollywood himself, Shahrukh Khan, hamming it up gloriously as a slightly dim-witted private detective who is innocently drawn into a conspiracy to assassinate the prime minister of India. The hilariously complex plot of mistaken identities and spy/counter spy is so twisted it took me several viewings to actually make it all out. (The fact that I was having to read subtitles didn't help) Surprisingly, the story holds together much better than it seemed to at first.<br /><br />Bollywood is notorious for stealing from Hollywood, and Baadshah is no exception. (For all you other non-Hindi speakers, ""Baadshah"" means King, like the one in a deck of cards) The opening dance number, Main Te Hoon Pagal, is clearly inspired by the ""Cuban Pete"" song from ""The Mask"", and later on whole scenes are copied nearly frame for frame from a couple of Jackie Chan movies: Mr. Nice Guy and Rush Hour. The results are just great good fun.<br /><br />The high point has to be the campy, outrageous ""Baadshah, O Baadshah"" nightclub number with Khan strutting his stuff amid a huge chorus of dancers in a whirl of silver lame and pyrotechnics. For a guy who claims to be a very bad dancer, he has an easy grace and agility that makes him a joy to watch.<br /><br />Khan's performance in Baadshah is perfect. The comedy is fantastic, and there isn't a dull moment. The supporting cast, including Twinkle Khanna, Johnny Lever (if you can stand him), and the ever-essential villain, Amrish Puri, are wonderful. Like most Hindi films, there's a mish-mash of everything you can imagine: drama, slapstick comedy, teary-eyed pathos (gotta see the Khan cry at least once in every film), romance (gotta see the hero dance around trees at least once in every film) high-tech James Bond gadgets, hilariously bad special effects; Baadshah has it all!",unsup
11289_0,"I saw this movie on TV as a kid and enjoyed it thoroughly -- Flying Tigers!<br /><br />I saw it again on TV tonight for the second time, and found it to be a howler from beginning to end. It's easy enough to find effective, cheaply made flag-waving propaganda movies made during the war years that have redeeming qualities, properties that make them worth watching. They may be no more than suspenseful actioners, like ""Destination Tokyo,"" or may have more thoughtful narratives embedded in the framework, like Hawks' ""Air Force."" ""God is My Co-Pilot"" hasn't got much of anything except a few minutes of good aerial photography. In the air, as usual, a kind of war-time trainer called the ""Texan"" substitutes for the Japanese Zero-sen, as it did in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" The P-40s are attractive airplanes, with clean lines, although they appear to be Model Es rather than the Cs the AVG used. A small matter. In any case, you can only admire the airplanes for so long before the story line and dialog begin to intrude into your consciousness. Scott's book was a simple, straightforward autobiography. The movie is piled high with extraneous material based on two themes: (1) a vicious and unrelenting racism that must have been offensive to some Americans over the age of ten even in 1945, and (2) something to do with whether Scott believes in God or not -- or was it the other way around? The dialog stretches desperately to reach upward to the level of banality but doesn't quite make it. I think I should give a few examples and leave it at that. Japanese pilot {played by Hawaiian-born Chinese-American Richard Loo} called ""Tokyo Joe"" radioing to a P-40 he has lined up in his sights: ""Just hold it right there, Yank."" P-40 pilot radioing back: ""Don't call me Yank; I'm from Georgia."" American pilot radioing to a Japanese pilot he's shooting down: ""Don't look now, but your Zero's showing."" American pilot to another Japanese going down in flames: ""Now you're a good Jap."" General Chennault watching from the ground with a big smile as his pilots slaughter the Japanese: ""The boys must be in a good mood today."" The real life epilogue? Chennault was a pretty clever guy, forsooth, trained his AVG mercenaries very effectively, and warned everyone back in the Western Hemisphere that the Japanese Zero was a remarkably maneuverable fighter, better than anything we had. (His warning was ignored; the Zero came as a big surprise after Pearl Harbor.) There was no room in the U. S. Army Air Force for a hero like Chennault, who had carved out a reputation in some other air force, namely the Chinese, and he was promptly ""disappeared."" The original AVG pilots were given the choice of becoming just another couple of guys in the Army Air Force or being kicked out and sent back to the states. AVG disbanded. End of Flying Tigers, except in our national mythology.",unsup

11290_0,"""A Philosophizing Irish Priest Is My Co-Pilot"". One of the silliest war movies ever. A dumb old film about pilots who can hardly wait to have their behinds blown to bits and strewn across the Asian sky. They all remind me of a similar side-character in ""Black Adder 4"". Watching this film, I realized just how much I was missing having some level-headed characters with a down-to-earth approach to flying missions, such as in Heller's ""Catch-22"" (one of the best books ever written, by the way). These dopes actually change their mind about going back home and decide to continue fighting just because some Jap taunted them over the radio! Are these people grown-ups or embryos? About as realistic as the lyrics in ""I Am The Walrus"". The dialogues are stiff and dull, and often supremely silly. Silly to the extent that some of the exchanges could have been written by none other than Ed Wood himself; an example would be the conversation between the hero and his girl. The Japanese pilots are nearly always shown grinning devilishly, and their flying skills are always poor - except for a character called Tokyo Joe, who taunts his American opponents with a series of comic-book-like phrases, all of which end with ""yank"". Then there is the wise old Irish priest, a walking movie cliché, with an unrivaled reservoir of ""hope-inspiring"" speeches. ""Yes... More dreams have been brought about by prayer than this world dreams of"", he says at the end, and I will leave that uncommented. (No, I won't: so what he is implying is that people must be constantly praying for natural disasters, wars, disease and misery.) Another unintentionally amusing Irish moment is when our hero pours out some of his deeper thoughts to the priest and the priest's first reaction is to say ""You're confused."" And yet another silly scene, involving our blessed Irishman of the cloth, is when he gives one of his grandiose speeches to our hero in a plane about belief in God, and the weather suddenly improves. Oh, yes; there's also the sausage-shaped dog who sniffs out the Japs from ten miles.",unsup

11292_0,"This movie helped the P40 to become my favorite warplane of all time. They used E models for the filming of this movie which would have been correct for mid-1942. The enemy planes incorrectly referred to as Zeroes were actually AT6 Texans which were almost always used in other movies as well. The flying scenes were filmed at Luke Air Force base in Arizona. The Flying Tigers fought against the Japanese Air Force which flew Ki-43 'Oscars'. The Imperial Navy pilots flew the Zero and were not involved in that conflict. The other thing that you see written often about the Flying Tigers is that they were fighting the Japanese ""years before"" Pearl Harbor. The truth is only Chenault was in China in the '30's helping out. The ground crews, pilots, and planes were not in place until November of 1941. Their first combat mission occurred on December 20, 13 days AFTER Pearl Harbor. Dennis Morgan, Alan Hale, & Richard Loo play their characters very well. Some people today are offended by all of the racial slurs that are uttered. But when this movie was made in 1945, the Japanese were the hated villains. The soldier's dilemma of taking lives as their duty versus what the 10 commandments says is dealt with tastefully in this movie. It's an enjoyable film that represents movies of the 1940's well.",unsup

11295_0,"The Flying Tigers roared onto the screen and into the imagination in two fairly good films: The Flying Tigers with John Wayne and God is My Co-Pilot, based upon the real life experiences of Colonel Scott. WWII was nothing like the politically correct war of current vintage. The American people did not love their enemy; they would have used the enemy's sacred writings for wholly sanitary purposes and bragged of the experience. The movie correctly shows this. On the other hand, in the spirit of Greater American Democracy, plenty of Neisi and Chinese actors had jobs as extras smiling at bombs away in the halycon years of the WW II propaganda movie.<br /><br />The book is still worth reading even today. More than a mere autobiography or piece of US war propaganda, Scott tells of the conflict between Chennault and Stillwell, the destruction of the Flying Tigers, the eclipse of the Chinese Nationalists and the rise of Mao.<br /><br />The movie has one glaring historical error in the movie: The July 4 1942 raid did not take place. The original AVG refused to fly.",unsup
11296_0,"This film was made as WWII was ending. The main interest in it was the exciting aerial photography used in it. For a propaganda film, ""God Is My Co-Pilot"" presents one aspect of the conflict in the Far East. It's a story about bravery and courage as the young pilots of The Flying Tigers fought the conflict.<br /><br />The story of a war hero, Colonel Robert Scott, is at the center of the film. Col. Scott knew no fear as he took to the air. His comrades, the other pilots of the squadron, admired him deeply as he set a clear example about how to serve his country unselfishly. The air combats shown in the film must have been amazing to the audiences of the time in which the movie was released.<br /><br />Robert Flarey directed a film that made those young aces heroes in what would become the powerful might of the Air Force in future conflicts. Dennis Morgan was perfect as Col. Scott, the man who knew no fear. Raymond Massey plays General Chennault. Alan Hale appears as the friendly priest Big Mike. Some other familiar faces in the cast, Dane Clark, Mark Stevens, Craig Stevens, and other.<br /><br />The only thing with the print recently shown by TCM looks as though the film was re-dubbed as the dialog doesn't match the lip movements of the actors in the film.",unsup

11299_0,"**SPOILERS** WWII war movie about the fabled ""Flying Tigers"" who battled the Japanese over the skies of China as early as 1937, four years before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and amassed a record of air-to-air combat kills against the Japanese air force of something like 40 to 1.<br /><br />The story ""God is my Co-Pilot"" actually begins in the summer of 1942 with USAF ace Col. Scott, Dennis Morgan, depressed and heart-broken because he can't be part of a major air assault against Japanese forces in China. The movie goes into a flashback where we see how Scott got interested in flying as a young boy back in Georgia and eventually joined the USAF ending up in China as the first US military man to become a member of the ""Flying Tigers""; The Tigers were exclusively made up of foreign, mostly Americans,volunteers. <br /><br />As you would expect the ""Flying Tigers"" airmen aren't that hip to a USAF man who's well over combat age, Scott is 34, joining up with their exclusive flying fighters squadrons. In no time at all Scott gets the hang of it and he becomes the hero, and to the battered and bloodied Japs,villain in the Chinese Theater of War. Back home in Macon Georga Scott's exploits make the front pages and his score of air-to air kills against the Japs are posted daily as if it was the score of a Championship Football or World Series Baseball game. <br /><br />The movie ""God is my Co-Pilot"" also has a Japanese villain in the person of Japanese air ace Tokyo Joe, Richard Loo, an American educated Japanese combat pilot who, by the number of USAF kill decals under the side-window of his Zero, seemed to have accounted for all the ""Flying Tiger"" P-40's shot down in China. Scott has a number of encounters with Tokyo Joe during the air combat in the movie and finally shoots him out of the sky by faking that he's in trouble, his engine is on fire, tricking Joe to lose his composure and overshoot his P-40. Scott ends up putting Joe right in the middle of his cross-hairs and thus became history and yesterdays news. Scott on a mission over Japanese held Hong Kong, where he downed Tokyo Joe, loses control of his plane and crashes and is given up for dead only to show up later alive and rescued by the local Chinese peasants. <br /><br />Dennis Morgan is both brave and humble as Col. Robert Lee Scott and even at the hight of the fighting has second thoughts about killing people, Japanese soldiers, even in wartime. Raymond Massey is excellent as the ""Flying Tiger"" commanded Gen Claire L. Chennault who answers Scott prayers at the end of the movie by giving him one last chance to go into combat. this after he was rendered useless as a combat pilot because of his nerves being shattered, from the combat missions he already flew, and the tropical illnesses he contracted in China. We never really get to know how Scott's last mission turned out since the movie ends before it even begins. <br /><br />Watching the movie it's obvious that it was non-other then Richard Loo as the wise-cracking Japanese air ace Tokyo Joe who has the best lines, which he delivers in perfect English, and the scenes with him interacting with the USAF and ""Flying Tiger"" pilots, like Col. Scott, are by far the best in the movie.",unsup

Cass Daley's broad and tiresome humor nearly sinks the enterprise and there is an excruciatingly long and very unfunny sequence involving Gil Lamb and an orchestra run amok.

11301_0,"With Simon well over a year ago, I had high hopes for Dutch cinema. This was a great film, about genuine people dealing with all things life (and death) in a genuine way. At least it got some well-deserved recognition outside the Netherlands, although I'm not sure how the movie performed across the pond- but I guess it stirred things up quite a bit in the US because of its daring content.<br /><br />Anyway, for those expecting Leef! to prolong the high standard set by Simon, prepare to be vastly disappointed. The film is incredibly pretentious in style and presentation. Why did it have to take 108 minutes of awkward dialogue and often pointless scenes to get to that point? I have no problem with it being pretentious, but not living up to it I do have a problem with. The camera-work and editing, especially in the first half, are overly artsy, sometimes hysterical and often completely unnecessary. On the contrary, it harms some of the (admittedly fine) performances in such a way that we cannot relate to the characters in any way, except for maybe Sybille, played by Anne-Wil Blankers, a great actress who is wholly out of place here. Jeroen Krabbé, always a treat, has a small part which is fine, but ruined by the horrific editing in that particular scene. A shame, I say.<br /><br />The dialogue is typical Dutch theatre fare, in that it is overly pretentious and artificial, which is a major gripe I have with Dutch theatre anyway. Even though this might have worked better on stage, it's still far too stiff and and insignificant to make the audience relate to the characters on an emotional level. Why not just trim it down and get to the point? Being mundane is no sin if the delivery is good. Here we the see actors struggling with lines they themselves most likely found to be awkward, which explains the wooden acting on the whole, I guess.<br /><br />Overall, what could have been a wonderful film about (family) life is a missed opportunity. This film gets lost in its own pretentiousness because of its lack of content and genuine emotional depth. Which, ultimately, to me, makes it a pointless affair.",unsup

It contains too many dramatic events spread over too many characters. Everybody in this film is totally wasted, the dialog is purely psychological jadajada and serves no function in telling a story that connects the different characters in a plot. As a viewer it is impossible to connect to one of the characters for longer than 2 minutes, their problems are merely unbelievable entertainment that just goes in with your popcorn but does not have any meaning. What also puzzles me is why they did not work with the same Director of Photography as in Cloaca, as it looked fantastic. Leef! however has a bleached out look, Using very hard light on the faces of the characters, I guess the idea was to enlarge their mental status by making them look more tormented, not very interesting to look at though.",unsup

One of her daughters is a problem child and the other one has a weak heart and her husband Paul (Peter Blok) is cheating on her.<br /><br />The premiere of Leef! was a real strange one, that was because of the director Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen died just two days before the premiere. I had a real double feeling about it because I'm a big fan of him so it was difficult the give an objective judge about the movie right away. Now it's a while ago and I think I can do it.<br /><br />Leef! is a great movie. First of all the acting in this movie is fantastic. Monic Hendrickx and Peter Blok are good as always, but also Sophie van Winden was great, it's one of her first movies, she did a great job. The camera is moving constantly, which creates entity in the movie. The music also creates the right feeling. The last days I heard a few times that people link this movie with movies like Magnolia and Short cuts. I don't think that's right. Leef! is good enough to judge it on itself. What is also said a lot is the the movie is (too) complex, indeed you have to think and pay attention to get everything, but since when is that not a good point. I like it to watch a movie actively. Of course there are also a few minuses, at the end there are too much improbabilities and cliché's to add everything together. So at the end it is too much of a feel good movie. But don't get me wrong, Leef! is a fantastic movie that shows real problems and that is harrowing to see. Leef! is about people, it's a movie with a heart and it is really a must to see.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to see the last movie of Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen, Ik omhels je met 1000 armen, which you can see in 2006.",unsup

Both films are about couples where both spouses are lawyers and both involve the couples going through marital difficulties brought on by their jobs.<br /><br />The film begins with Rosalind Russell undergoing a confirmation hearing to make her a federal judge. However, her ex-husband (Robert Cummings) appears at the trial and does everything he can to discredit her. He wants her back in the worst way and will do anything to get her attention. Surprisingly, he is able to scheme his way into agreeing to remarry. However, due to the scheming of her grandfather (Henry Stevenson), Cummings disappears on his wedding night and Russell has had enough--she absolutely won't take him back, as she has no idea that Stevenson was behind the disappearance. And, for that matter, neither does Cummings know how he suddenly woke up on a train headed for Charlotte, North Carolina...and with a suitcase filled with women's clothes! <br /><br />The press has found out that Russell has married but they have no idea to whom. She doesn't want to admit that she remarried her ex- and they are already going to get another divorce, so she quickly concocts a crazy tale about her husband getting killed on their wedding day! This ""Mr. Rugle"" was apparently heading to South America and crashed in Guatemala!!! When Cummings arrives, he informs everyone that Rugle is NOT dead but has survived in order to put Russell on the spot. But, in a case of GOOD quick-thinking (as opposed to her crazy Rugle story), she finds a stand-in to pretend to be Rugle. Now what is Cummnigs to do?! There's a lot more to this screwball comedy. <br /><br />While the story is patently silly and tough to believe (and then some), it is high-energy and most enjoyable. Cummings steals the show and shows his deftness with comedy and I'd watch Russell in any comedy, as they always turn out great. It also helped that Gig Young was on hand to play Mr. Rugle--and seeming to enjoy taking advantage of the situation. And, in turn, Cummings did everything he could do to come between them.<br /><br />By the way, try reading up on co-star Marie McDonald--her IMDb profile is bizarre yet fascinating.",unsup

Some funny set-pieces (such as Roz's bit involving a lipstick mistake) and a predictably sunny, smooth supporting performance by Gig Young as a dashing Romeo make it tolerable, but the script and characters are really second hand.

Russell plays Marsha Meredith, a recently divorced woman up for a judgeship, encouraged in her career by her judge grandfather (Harry Davenport). The ex-husband, however, Pete Webb (Cummings) wants her back. The two are still in love. The divorce was basically a misunderstanding - Webb was working with a beautiful blond witness (McDonald) and Marsha mistook it for something else. Even though it puts her career in jeopardy, Marsha remarries Pete. On their wedding night, her grandfather kidnaps Pete so that Marsha thinks he's up to his old tricks. She then takes off and announces to the press that she's married to someone else, and makes up a name. When Alexander (Gig Young), a man she met previously appears, she has him play the part of her husband.<br /><br />This is a typical screwball comedy centering around the struggle that the independent woman has between being a career person and a wife - and apparently back then, it was one or the other. I thought Russell was fine as Marsha, unlike another reviewer - I've seen her miscast, and I didn't think she was this time - but I agree with another remark the poster made, that Bob Cummings steals the movie. Cummings is thought of as a bland film actor, and perhaps he was. What made him a tremendous television star was his sense of comedy, which he didn't get to use much in films but which was his strength. Here he gets to show it off, and a few years later, he made his mark in television.<br /><br />A fun movie, not earth-shattering, as films were going through a difficult transition.

A typical setup for the divorce-remorse films that came along in the 40s.<br /><br />Then there's Gig Young as the rival for Russell's affection, Clem Bevans as Mr. Roogle (it rhymes with bugle) and Marie McDonald adding a funny twist as the witness who keeps stalking Bob. For the most part, the cast is on top of their game and has some great moments. However, be forewarned, this is not Rosalind Russell's best work by a long shot. Despite the fact that she's given some wonderful performances (Auntie Mame, Trouble With Angels, etc) she's not very strong here and this is one situation where I really think another actress should have been cast. (Too bad Carole Lombard was already gone - she would have been PERFECT.) Some time the twists go a bit too far and get rather tedious on repeat watchings, but this is the screwball genre - it's not supposed to be realistic.

But the movie is ruined by three gigantic flaws.<br /><br />First, it is incompetently edited. It is obvious that some key scenes were left out and as a result, the plot is hard to follow. For example, at one point the agents go off to visit the mother of one of them. The next time we see them, they are back from the visit and have a new character, Willem, with them. All we get is a one sentence explanation for who he is and why he is with them.<br /><br />Second, the motivations of the various Dutch army units are baffling and never explained. Some of them help the agents while others try to kill the agents. At some points, different Dutch army units shoot at each other. We are never told why some of them are trying to kill the agents. Are they disloyal soldiers trying to help the Germans? Or do they believe that the agents are working for the Germans? Or do they think the diamonds should stay in Holland even if it is overrun by the Germans? Or do they think the Germans will fail to capture Amsterdam and, thus, it is unnecessary to take the diamonds out? <br /><br />Third, a group of about a dozen Dutch civilians help the agents get diamonds out of a bank safe and blow up a oil storage facility. It is never explained who these people are. They are not the Dutch underground. That was formed only after the Germans overran Holland; but this movie is set before they'd captured Amsterdam.",unsup

Firstly, yes the sudden appearance of Willem suggested a cut scene, a frequent occurrence in many movies, owing to pacing and duration considerations - could have been better handled, but it was explained briefly. Secondly, the various groups of Dutch soldiers, some fighting each other, was fully explained several times in the dialogue - the city has been infiltrated with German fifth columnists, and nobody is sure who is friend or foe! In the battle scene by the canal the late arrivals have been sent by the man at the government department, to help the 'good guys'. Thirdly, you are correct that the OFFICIAL Dutch resistance was not yet organised, but the resistance fighters in the story are early volunteers who are trying to hamper the German occupation of Amsterdam, and will no doubt form the nucleus of the resistance movement that would soon follow.

It has both a strong story and some unusual cinematic touches to keep the viewer interested.<br /><br />The story of the British secret service agents who are sent to Amsterdam to recover industrial diamonds before the German invasion is a familiar one, and their eventual safe escape is predictable enough.<br /><br />What interested me was the atmosphere of fear and bleakness that the producers manage to convey. The empty streets, in bright sunlight; the columns of fleeing people; the confusion of not knowing who are enemies or friends, makes for a better than average effects.<br /><br />Added to this a score made only with drums, and some very abrupt editing that is almost painful to watch, makes this a worthwhile watch.",unsup
11315_0,"The movie makes the best out of a fairly unique story that is probably based on true historical facts. It is about a one day expedition to Amsterdam in May 1940, shortly before the arrival of the invading German troops. In a race against time exiled Dutch jewelers try to get all the industrial diamonds out of the country and bring them to Britain before the Germans can take them. It is a quick in and out operation organised by the British government that has to be accomplished in one day - and no easy task as the jewelers have to be convinced by sheer argument it is the right and sensible thing to do (hard to decide in the Netherlands in May 1940, I am certain).<br /><br />In a strange way this movie is surrealistic and realistic at the same time. There is a lot of good location shooting, the sun drenched streets of Amsterdam are virtually deserted, the atmosphere is ghostly. At times there is gunfire in the distance. There are some disoriented Dutch soldiers hanging around, or shall I say loitering? The effect is strangely threatening. At one time two groups of soldiers start shooting at each other. In another scene, one of the day trippers steps into a pub in a totally empty square. And there they are, the Dutch! Sitting peacefully behind their pints and discussing the latest news from the front. The transition really took me completely by surprise, it was incongruous but strangely effective and somehow totally believable.<br /><br />There are harrowing scenes. When the day trippers disembark, the harbour is in chaos and full of refugees  a strong contrast to the mentioned deserted streets in the town center. When they finally succeed in organising a meeting with all of Amsterdam's important jewelers, their Jewish colleagues express the opinion that for them it might be wiser not to make the Germans angry by giving away the jewels. They can be convinced to agree to the evacuation of the stones that are invaluable to the armament industry, although it is made perfectly clear that the day trippers can take no refugees with them. All these issues are treated in a rational and unemotional way which actually strengthens the impact of the tragic situation.<br /><br />In addition the movie also has some action scenes, a car chase and, as the culmination of the absurd general situation, the heist of a jewel depository by partisans who help the day trippers, with an ensuing fierce shootout with a detachment of Dutch troops. The acting is good, Peter Finch (Network) is cool as usual and gives a convincing performance as the son of an eminent Amsterdam jeweler and leader of the expedition. Eva Bartok is stylishly beautiful and enigmatic as a Dutch woman with uncertain alignments who joins the day trippers after they saved her from a suicide attempt (driving her car over the pier in the harbor, a car, incidentally, that comes in mighty handy).

He also finds that the father of Ally is more concerned about his business and sex life then he is about his daughter. The students and faculty are all convinced that he has something to do with the kidnapping, and he is questioned and interrogated many times. With some interesting plot twists and and fair storyline, I enjoyed this movie. But, from the title, I would like to say that there was no reason what so ever to have the scene of nudity in it that it did, it was purely disgusting. With that being said, I give this movie a 7/10.",unsup
11318_0,"let's get the good stuff out of the way first...<br /><br />the story line and the writing both are amazing... in the hands of a more capable director, this movie could've been an excellent movie.<br /><br />the story has all the elements that could attract a viewer, from the good building of the problem, the attraction, the deliberate misguiding to the twists at the end. (but no comedy whatsoever)..<br /><br />but it was really really really bad directed, and you can notice that from the very first shot of the film. a summer trained director trying his luck, and thinking that having a star like Hayden Panettiere can sell the movie - which i don't know why she agreed to do the movie in the first place?? being that she's totally in her prime...<br /><br />there are some characters in the movie that were in it only for the purpose of the felling of an empty 5 minutes or something, there are characters that appeared in the beginning of the movie, and it was set in my mind that this character will play an important rule in the story line, but suddenly i didn't see that character again!!!!<br /><br />overall, it was below medium, and really what a sham, it could've been something really good.<br /><br />my vote is 3 out of 10",unsup
11319_0,"It wasn't awful, but this movie is pretty forgettable. With only a couple of exceptions, the characters came off as two dimensional, their actions made no sense and seemed totally unrealistic. The actors did a passable job with what they had. The dialogue had a few chuckles but largely felt short of witty, and it couldn't seem to commit to comedy and instead comes off as a not so compelling drama with a few comic moments. I will say the end was unexpected to me, but it didn't really make up for the flaws.<br /><br />Of course, Hayden Panettierre is really hot, and if you enjoy looking at her this movie is probably worth seeing just for that.",unsup

The idea to put Eugene Levy and Sam Jackson in a movie together was a clever one. They bounce off each other perfectly. The jokes in the movie range from farting humor to Eugene Levy explaining that the human bite is very painful (which I found funny). I found the film to be above average funny.<br /><br />The film's humor and suspense are abundant enough to keep you watching the whole 83 minutes. It is definitely a great movie to watch just to burn time.<br /><br />7/10.",unsup
11320_0,"The story is based on a real gossip some years ago in Korea, and focusing on the eternal, condition-less love between a naive peasant and a bereft ex-prostitute whose past is somewhere under the body of many male CLIENTs. Every love has its own silver line and every lover has his/her own attitude; But, the love between this couple is too candid to be understood but to be appreciated. As no scientific paradigm cannot define THE LOVE, this movie just illustrates what love gotta be even under extreme background.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the emotion of love affair and the instinct of affection should be separated. This movie, regrettably, fails in the depiction of love itself but concentrates on the struggle for keeping his/her aficionado toward each other against all social rules and interference. Love will shine when it's against all odds. However, these odds are too exaggerated in the movie to be overcome by love itself, otherwise making the love tattered with uncompromising and painful memories.<br /><br />Director's endeavor to gather every piece of elegiac elements is too evident, and the performances of two actor/actress are very easy going, enough to make audiences lost in the clearly ""schematized"" sadness.",unsup
11321_0,"I remember the actress Do-yeon Jeon who plays Eun-ha here from a subsequent film, the uncompromising, depressing ""Secret Sunshine"". She was amazing in that film and is just as good here, as a waitress/hostess. Jeong-min Hwang plays the fairly naive bumpkin like Suk-jung, who falls for her. It takes a long time for her to warm up to the idea of him as a boyfriend, but she does. Then, it is found out she has HIV. He vows to search for her, to always take care of her. This is the kind of film that only works as a film. I suppose the message is to follow your heart. Many people will be turned off by this film and not only for moral reasons. They may feel it is manipulative. However, the film is never boring and Do-yeon Jeon is a terrific actress. I'm going to see if she has done comedy because she was the lead in two very dramatic, soul searching but sad roles. If you can get past the storyline, the film is well made. Does love conquer all? Thats what this film tries to answer for you.",unsup
11322_0,"You Are My Sunshine is one of those films that's sneaky in a way you don't expect. The director, Park Jinpyo had previously directed a romantic drama about septuagenarians in love, wrapping a serious social issue (ageism) around an accessible drama. Like his previous film, Park now approaches another social topic (AIDS stigma/prostitution) obliquely, by bringing taking those issues and wrapping them in a well wrought melodrama.<br /><br />The story follows a simple and idealistic country farmer who lives a lovelorn life, a common problem with a lot of rural Korea as many young men and women migrate to urban centers, leaving bachelors with few options. Well, he meets a coffeeshop girl (which, at some coffeeshops also suggest that they double as hostesses and prostitutes) and despite knowing her profession, is absolutely smitten. A sort of romantic comedy ensues, with conflict erupting from her own chilly disposition towards romance and the conflict arising from how this farmer's family reacts to the idea of a prostitute dating him. And then her past catches up to her, AIDS makes an appearance and things go straight into melodrama land.<br /><br />However, the melodrama never really hits the clichés that had previously become all to overdone in Korean cinema. There are no deathbed scenes, although there are trips to the hospitals, and the film doesn't try to flood you with tearjerking scenes. In fact, because of the studied character development and believable reactions, the film actually earns every single melodramatic moment and so the one truly emotional moment has a lot of potency going for it, despite how simple it is. As such, this is an example of melodrama done right. And while it's doing it, it addresses the AIDS stigma, problems prevalent in the lives of sex workers and doesn't really pull punches while doing so.<br /><br />Of course, when dealing with such clichés, acting really makes a difference and the two leads do an excellent job of convincing you of their characters and believably walking with the characters as they develop. The rest of the film is quite proficient too, with some beautifully shot scenes. The film only slows down a little after the midpoint as we deal with the characters on their own, but the ending really makes it all worthwhile.<br /><br />So, what you have here with You Are My Sunshine is a really solid melodrama. It manages to avoid the worst of the clichés, stay in the genre and play it straight, make an impact and wrap in commentary on real social issues while making of solid dramatic entertainment. Good. 8/10.",unsup
11323_0,"Touted as the biggest love story in Korea in 2005, it is no surprise why the hype. Based/Inspired by a true story (there had been a handful of such movies in the recent weeks), You are My Sunshine is your typical melodramatic romance, with leads so cute and pretty, you can't help but be captivated as you embark on their journey of love.<br /><br />It brings to mind a frequently asked question, whether it is better to love, or be loved. Seok-joong (Hwang Jeong-min) is a affable, simple minded hillbilly farmer, who dreams of getting married to the woman of his dreams, and settling down in a cattle ranch. Luckless in love, he contemplates going abroad to look for a Filipino wife, just as one of his buddies did. But anyhow soon after, he meets Eun-ha (Jeon Do-yeon), a ""coffee"" girl who also moonlights as a karaoke hostess, and falls head over heels with her.<br /><br />Eun-ha is a complex woman with a shady past, but although we were not told exactly what, from Do-yeon's portrayal, it doesn't take a genius to warrant an accurate guess. She's extremely guarded and frosty, having lost hope in men, but eventually gets touched by Seok-joong's sincerity. Who says your average joe couldn't snag that hot babe, if he tries doggedly hard, and is thick skinned about it? And thick skinned he sure is, as he forges ahead in marriage despite objections from his aged mother. The movie then moves onto a different plane, looking at societal prejudices against people of certain trades, as well as misinformation about the disease AIDS. Eun-ha's past catches up with her (shades of Banderas-Jolie's Original Sin here), and Seok-joong learns of her being inflicted with the disease. Eun-ha disappears, and the village folk gets flustered in having to undergo HIV testing, putting the blame of the introduction of the disease on Seok-joong.<br /><br />It's always difficult when you want to shake off the past, but yet get haunted by its ghost. You're seeking a new and ideal life, and it's always blissful to be with a loved one. You know the romance bit pauses and the melodrama sets in after the introduction of the ex-boyfriend, and the pacing of the movie suffered with the discovery of the illness thereafter.<br /><br />I was waiting for scenes which will turn on the tear ducts. There were ample potential ones like the uneventful searches, the longing, the loss, but they were all building up the emotions to that one scene near the end, where you really feel the love lost, of being so close yet so far, the longing feeling to hold your loved one in your arms, to embrace them in warmth, to keep them safe from harm and to shower them with your love. Damn power, and really heart-wrenching, although it sort of looked comedic at the start.<br /><br />As the alternative to another Korean romance Daisy, this one tended to be a little more intimate mature, and being less flashy. If you're up for some good old fashioned weepy, then You are My Sunshine is your choice between the two.",unsup

I can't wait to pick it up on DVD to finally know some of the dialog that had every Korean person in the theta sobbing by the end of the movie. Really, a great story. You Are My Sunshine (English title) covers the issue of AIDS as well as prostitution, two topics that are still a little taboo in Korea, as well as much of Asia.",unsup
11325_0,Fell in love with this show the first time I watched it. I watched the dub and I gotta say I loved it. Later I would watch the sub but didn't find it as appealing. The English version is best for people who don't know Japanese. The type of anime that it is just makes it more entertaining to hear in English. It's a great show and yes the dub may not be 100% accurate or great but you can relate to the characters emotions when in English. The new DVD dub is kinda dry. I prefer the VHS dub which are more laid back and well the voices bring out the characters a lot better. The DVD was re-dubbed because a few seconds of episode 2 where nagisa gropes shuns younger brother were cut out in the dub but left in the sub VHS. This isn't a dirty anime or something. It's a well funny light hearted type of anime that if you liked series like tenchi muyo etc would love.,unsup

It's about a young boy who moves a dorm but the administration places him with 3 other slightly strange roommates. They gradually get to know and trust one another, and you learn about each one's story. I think they were in the high school/college age range. Each character has their own ""special"" quirk and problems they're trying to fix. It's a great drama/comedy that is funny and serious in the right spots. It might be too slow moving for some people but you just have to give it a chance. At the time, I didn't think I would enjoy it but I really liked this series. I wish there were more episodes.",unsup
11327_0,"After being disgusted by the first D&D movie, I went into the Wrath of the Dragon God with trepidation. Even so, I tried to keep hope that the producers would make amends for their previous failure. Well, they honestly tried.... The action and CGI was much better, however there were many points where it was unbelievable. The ACTING was greatly improved. The story fit the D&D feel a little more. Being an AD&D player for many years now, I was still let down by the rudimentary knowledge the producers seem to have about D&D. I wish they would find some REAL actors, have a REAL adult story, and REALLY know their stuff when it comes to the D&D GAME ASPECTS. There are so many great things that D&D has as a game that could be put into a great movie... too bad no one can get their stuff together enough to do it.",unsup
11328_0,"From what I had heard about the first film, I was better off skipping it and watching the second. When the opportunity arose to do that, I decided to seize it since I had a couple of hours that I could waste. I can't compare it to the first in the series, but as a Dungeons and Dragons player since the 80s and a great fan of fantasy, I can analyse it on its own merits.<br /><br />The first thing and the main thing that impressed me was the inclusion of several aspects from the actual game. I really liked the little touches of detail. Spells, items, monsters and more were all here. It was really wonderful to see all these brought to life.<br /><br />The second was that it really did have a very distinctly Dungeons and Dragons feel to it, rather than just any fantasy film. There was an eye to things that fans and players would know, and that made it distinctly identifiable, which was nice; so often filmmakers, especially Hollywood, are notorious for tacking on an inapplicable brand name to a barely identifiable film tie-in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite all these things, making it Dungeons and Dragons doesn't necessarily make it good Dungeons and Dragons. The film was a rather bitter and unhappy affair, and I found myself often really brought down by its miserable tone throughout. It is comparable to taking your character to a session run by a stranger, who has bought a module at a rummage sale somewhere and wants to inflict it upon you; he doesn't really know very well how to run the game and tries as hard as he can to destroy you all, to give himself some sort of sadistic pleasure. Afterwards, unhappy with the experience, you take your character and file him away, to be brought around for another campaign run, instead, by someone you know and trust. Which may not happen for years. And at that point you conveniently omit that one odd session out, because it was that unenjoyable.<br /><br />And that's essentially what this film is: a bad module run by a nasty, childish sadist of a dungeonmaster. The story is relentlessly depressing and poorly-handled in every such aspect, and it additionally functions to make virtually all of the characters difficult to sympathise with or even care about. The leader is completely bland, although his love Melora was the high point of the film (and, predictably, the most tormented). The Elf mage was interesting but underused, the female barbarian was there solely for eye candy (though she did a pretty good job with her lacking part), and the cleric was there because someone apparently thought clerics were useless. All of us who know otherwise sent up a collective groan at the treatment of this one.<br /><br />The rogue was a good actor, but his part was similarly inane and the character completely unlikable. He also ended up underused in the parts that could've shown his strengths, and overused in parts where he was completely superfluous. The villain was utterly forgettable unfortunately, although the monster effects were quite memorable indeed. I really did enjoy the dragons and so forth, especially the ultimate confrontation. Really exciting and really well done.<br /><br />It's just a pity that the rest had to be endured to get there. This is the kind of story that you hear from people who decided to try the game once, got some garbage like this thrown at them, and ended up quitting and never again going near a tabletop game. It's sad, but it's amazing what an inept dungeonmaster can do for someone's enthusiasm. That's essentially what happened here.<br /><br />And while the details were nice for a while, there were times when they were just useless and frustrating. We had a Drow throwaway joke, but where were any actual Drow? We had a 'necropolis' (cleverly masquerading as a sylvan glen) complete with a lich, but what real purpose did it serve? And so on.<br /><br />If there had been more of a heroic, pleasant fantasy tone rather than a by-the-numbers destroy-em-all gauntlet tone, it would've been much more satisfying. As it was, it gave the impression of enduring the film, rather than enjoying it. There were some pleasant parts and some nice aspects, some talented people trying to do their best with lacking parts and ludicrous circumstances, but the tale itself was all too unpleasant. And as any player of Dungeons and Dragons knows, the story is everything.<br /><br />It wasn't a complete loss. It's not totally a horror. But it is by no means a fantastic film, unfortunately for those who put so much energy into it. Hopefully if they do a third one, they will go for a better situation and different villain, as well as a less depressing, unhappy, and just plain unpleasant story.<br /><br />And for pity's sake, somebody tell the DM that nobody likes to play games with someone trying hard to get them killed!",unsup
11329_0,"I'm somewhat familiar with DND and RP'ing in general. I even LARP'd in high school. I really enjoyed this film. I actually felt like I was watching a DND campaign come to life! I wasn't expecting cinematic genius here, just a decent adventure, and this movie delivers. It's almost like reading a fantasy short story.<br /><br />I also watched the special features beforehand. It really helped to see how passionate the people were and how much they respected DND. It seems like a good bunch of people that just wants the audience to have fun.<br /><br />I honestly think that anyone who complains about CGI not being good enough or how ""cheesy"" it was, is too young to give intelligent critiques. This is a bunch of hard working, unfamous British actors in Lithuania trying to entertain you for 105 minutes. Honestly, I really appreciate the effort they put in.",unsup

11330_0,"Let me explain my view before some of you decide that I'm mad. Firstly most sane people agree the 1st film was absolute garbage. This film has many strengths. The plot, there is a reasonable plot with high level characters taking on an epic quest. The details, a great level of detail on the world actually having a history which gives the setting realism. The enemies, they were interesting having more than just one agenda. The good guys, although certain area's with the characters were a bit plastic, they did have character which was lacking in the first. The traps and puzzles, very impressed with the traps and puzzles which were overcome using methods that players could imagine. Clichés are limited which cannot be the same for many other films of this type( one being released recently and hyped to hell!!!) In conclusion this isn't the best film I have ever seen but it does have a lot of the elements that I wanted to see and I hope will spawn more films of this type but maybe a series starting the characters from their first adventure. It'd be good to see a fighter having a go at skeletons and zombies and being terrified and frustrated when bow fire has little or no effect.",unsup
11331_0,"Gaining from five more years of CGI technology advancements, this movie is far superior than the original Dungeons & Dragons, even if still lacking the blockbuster status. The story is a good one, for D&D standards, and most of the peculiarities of the game are well inserted in the plot. From the choosing of the five heroes to return the orb, each with his/her skills put in evidence during the course of the story, to the villains - a lich, a necromancer, an undead skeletal dragon - to the use of D&D deities - Obadai. All the choices in the movies are well done, the casting is very good, with a good mix of races and male and female heroes, and the total effect is a good cinematic adventure, better than a more publicized effort like the infamous Earthsea.",unsup
11332_0,"While the original film had the action/Hollywood feel to it, it didn't seem much like D&D in the slightest. This one improves on that greatly. I was interested in the plot, even though it did tend to drag on at times, mostly the beginning. I liked how the characters actually matched D&D classes, and each one performed their duties as such. There was something missing, though I'm not quite sure what it was, and there were also some things that didn't quite mesh. Overall it matches D&D very well though, and a fan would have to be very picky for it to matter. I thought the cast acted well, as nobody was over the top or tried to call attention to themselves as super-hero extraordinaire (unlike the first movie). I was also disappointed to find out the lack of other work Chidzley has been involved in, but that's not movie related... oh well.",unsup

This is a very good fantasy movie with good plot, acceptable acting and good FXs.<br /><br />One thing that I really liked was that the writers actually looked into the game and took spells, gods and history right out of the books AND got it right.<br /><br />There is cheese as there will be in any sword and spell movie but it was funny and fit the characters.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed this file.<br /><br />If your looking for a fantasy Sword and magic with Dragons movie this is for you.",unsup

We have our villain, Damodar AKA Mr Blue-Lip-Gloss (who was the evil side-kick from the first movie). And of course we have our bunch of heroes, a banded together D&D cliché group consisting of a thief, swordswoman, wizard-type, and other generic types. Unfortunately they each die before you can really associate with their characters (unlike the first movie). A few scenes hinted at some promise to the movie, such as the ""blink and you'll miss it"" battle against the Ice Dragon, but ultimately these random skirmishes, plus the anti-climactic climax do little to save this movie from the DVD bargain bin.<br /><br />Spoilers End -<br /><br />This movie also has a ""made for TV"" feel to it as well.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to general movie viewers, but if you enjoy D&D fantasy movies, this will be some entertainment, but it's far from a classic in the genre and pales in comparison to many big budget fantasy films.",unsup
11335_0,"I had expected this sequel to be in line with the first D&D movie with regards to the general feel and content/quality, but was quite disappointed.<br /><br />The visual effects were notably a lot worse, a lot of jerky, stuttered animation in the movements of the creatures, not at all the same kind of quite natural movement I expected to see after having seen the first movie. Lack of detail, cheesy transitions, poor interaction of rendered with real-world elements. There are more different creatures from the fantasy realm in this movie, but none of them are executed well, or even convincingly. Cutting corners with lots of gray and black.<br /><br />Then, the acting: Sure, it's not been a strong point in the first movie either, but once again, a lot less convincing to put the characters down. No depth to them, feeling more like a high-school play at times which is also indicative of poor directing and a scripts with no real interest in telling a story, but rather to ""produce"".<br /><br />I like the fantasy genre, I enjoy the setting this movie plays in. The medieval feel of all the extras was good, and some nice stunts there with the (many) explosions, but overall: a thin story, poor acting of the main characters, and horrendously B-movie special effects make this movie one that only barely scrapes a score of 3 out of me.<br /><br />It's is OK to watch once.

11336_0,"Simply horrible. Very low-budget pseudo-sequel to the previous film with none of the same actors except one. It almost makes the first one look like a masterpiece. From the few extras, it seems that the creators actually wanted to do well and take this seriously but it certainly doesn't show in the final product except for a lack of b-movie fun that might have actually made this palatable. The fight choreography was lame, the dialogs were cliché, the special effects were pathetic (except perhaps for the first dragon but even there...), the actors were either mediocre or stunningly uncharismatic and the story... well I don't remember what the story was nor did I care much about what was happening. Actually, I saw this not so long ago and I remember very little of it. I'm giving an extra half star for the effort and genuinely noble intentions of the filmmakers who did try to make it closer to the rpg and because I've seen worse. Dungeons & Dragons deserves a much better movie. Why not one based on some of the Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance novels? <br /><br />Rating: 3 out of 10",unsup
11337_0,"What can I say? I'm a movie-lover, game player and game designer, so of course I'm going to see flaws others will not. However, this movie doesn't really have anything outstandingly ""bad"". It does have some dumb spots, so I'll cover those quick and get them out of the way: 1) A Mage summoning a creature of fire in the library of priceless lore and nobody being concerned or telling her ""do that outside"", then they wonder when things catch fire. 2) A pit/floor trap with spikes that shoot up from below in an elevated hut where there is clearly nothing visible beneath the floor once they're outside again. 3) A lot of single lines that are too ""B"" in feel and distract from the atmosphere of the movie. Now, on to the good stuff. Like role-playing games themselves, this movie takes a little getting used to. It's easy to spot a single bad line or act of stupidity by a hero (and there are plenty of them), but I ask: If every movie hero never made any mistakes, would we really like them? Gamers make mistakes. It helps the ""feel"" of the film. The script is very well put together, balancing the two very different realms of a good ""game adventure"" and a plot that works within the style of a movie. The references to the D&D literature (both rules and classic AD&D modules) was very good, the plot made sense, it incorporated plenty of ""D&D style"", and it had a different feel to it. This does not feel like a TV movie, but it clearly isn't Lord of the Rings, either. But it's not trying to be. What is nice about this movie is that it is simply trying to be itself, and the ""feel of D&D"" comes through nicely because of that. I think they did well with what they had to work with (continuing a horrible initial film's story, low budget, and probably competitive producers as well). All I can say is that, both as a gamer and a fan of fantasy film, I was satisfied. If I want high drama and epic film-making, that's what LOTR is for. I'll put this D&D movie on the same shelf as Army of Darkness and The Mummy, as good adventure romps that I'll watch again and again.",unsup

Finally if you have played the game and are worried about watching another mockery of the game you love be assured this will not let you down, watch/listen for all the realistic game stuff.

11339_0,"This was on the whole, an enjoyable fantasy movie. Players of the Dungeons & Dragons game will be pleased to find references to material from the game. Those unfamiliar with the game will still enjoy it as an action-oriented fantasy movie. <br /><br />The drawbacks of this movie include a script that sometimes gets bogged down in melodrama, especially with the main villain's long-winded monologues about his evil plans (particularly at the beginning of the film). Other elements are campy, but done with enough tongue-in-cheek attitude to give me a chuckle or two. The movie also suffers from some minor sub-par theatrical production values. Since it was a direct-to-video/TV movie, these faults are largely forgivable. The most glaring examples are that some make-up work looks drawn in with marking pen and some monsters clearly look CGI. Special effects are about the same quality as the Hercules and Xena TV series, so I was still able to enjoy the movie despite these flaws.<br /><br />Even with all of the above against it, the movie is still several times better from the theatrical Dungeons & Dragons movie that came before it. The producers wisely dumped all of the characters and plot except the bad guy's assistant, Profion, from the first movie; changed the setting; and conformed the fantasy world to be more in line with the latest version of the Dungeon & Dragons game. Those changes make for a movie that is light years ahead of the predecessor and much more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The magic and monsters (especially the dragons) are fun to watch. The ""rogue"" of the party (an expert in disarming traps, picking locks, and other sneaky stuff) is the most interesting of the bunch.

It was poorly paced, it was not well written, Irons was just awful and Birch was so amazingly whiny that I was rooting for her death. That's just as a movie goer. My husband was just speechless - for about 5 minutes. After that I got the whole rant, but the thing I remember most was how incredibly annoyed he was that throwing a rock would fool a Beholder. Heh.<br /><br />This movie was great. It was fun, there was adventure, there were traps, there were dragons, there was a lich (even I know what a lich is). The characters were engaging and the actors were good enough that I believed them in their roles (something else the first movie was lacking). I liked the older cast, too. That was a nice change. I just couldn't have believed that untried adventurers would be sent on such an important mission. So as a non D&D fanatic, I enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />My husband was thrilled enough that he did not nit pick it to death, a bad habit he has during most movies. He was very happy to have D&D well represented in the movie, was pleased with the over all effects and the fact that the cleric didn't use edged weapons, that the elven wizard couldn't cast everything just because she was a wizard...and more things that I can't remember off hand.<br /><br />This movie was good fun and kept my attention - something that is quite difficult sometimes. The pacing was great, which helped a lot. The characters were likable and believable and the story was good. I'd recommend this one without reservation, where as I'd never EVER recommend the first movie.",unsup
11341_0,"The first D&D movie was one of the worse I'd ever seen; even more so as I'm a fan of D&D. The monsters didn't act like monsters out of D&D, the villains and heroes were all morons, the spell effects whilst OK in places were a bit over the top elsewhere, the magic was either all very weak or of artifact level, there were *way* too many dragons acting very non-dragon like, the plot was full of holes, etc. etc.<br /><br />In this movie at least the monsters, although there aren't too many of them, act like they are meant to. There's much more of a variety of magic and the effects are good. There's a few puzzles, and outdoor, indoor & dungeon adventures - a good mix. The good guys as well as the bad guys get wounded - and not just lightly. The heroes are also a lot more natural and likable, although still a bit two-dimensional, and the plot is still a bit weak compared to a decently written adventure for D&D, but in comparison with the first film this one is an Oscar nominee. So, overall a decent B-grade Fantasy. If you swore you'd never watch another D&D movie after the first one, it might be worthwhile reconsidering. If only we could get Drizzt onto the big screen...",unsup
11342_0,"OK, firstly if your not a fan of RPG's or Dungeons & Dragons the Game, you probably should stay away from this film. As a film its fairly average , with undistinguished, but not awful acting, low budget effects, and basic plot outline. That all said as a fantasy film its got all the requirements you want, villains, monsters, a party of heroes, Inter-party conflict, and high magic. I really enjoyed this film, it contained many classic elements from the D&D game: From a Vorpal sword, walls of fire, fiendish traps, strange monsters, and classic character classes. <br /><br />It was far more the film that the first outing should have been, which was truly awful. it is a shame it didn't have a larger budget. That said it sits high up in the ranks of Fantasy Movies.",unsup

At least it was better than that sewer slop that was the first movie. The cast was better and they seemed to focus more on the quest than just idiot humor. I had hoped it would help the genre, but I think it fell short of that. I say get rid of Damodar and the city and start over again. Doing that could only help any more D&D movies they may make. If you're a D&D fan, it's worth taking the time to watch it, but I wouldn't buy it on DVD or anything, unless you bought the first one and just want to have the set. It's not worth the money.",unsup
11344_0,Very good sequel to the original flop from 2000. For what seemed to be a lower budget movie being made for TV. Way better acting and cgi. I was a bit dismayed when I found that it was a sequel to that one due to its cheese factor.<br /><br />The only flub I noted was when the half elf wizardess teleported them into damadar's lair. She cast it with one hand and the other came out stuck in the wall upon landing and I assumed she was holding her staff in it so why was it not stuck in the wall too? When they ported back out she appeared holding the staff while the fighter/lord guy was carrying her. And truly they should have been physically touching for them to go along.<br /><br />Other then those small oversights the movie was a very well done. It made me glad to see that a Dungeons and Dragons movie could be made with a good story and not as cheesy as the movie that it was descended from.<br /><br />The cleric being wrongfully portrayed as wise and battle worn would not have been dumb enough to try to face down a white dragon like that alone. That was a novice move.,unsup
11345_0,"I must admit, I was impressed on several levels with this sequel. As far as the flaws, I can see some of the bad cgi, some cheesy acting, low budget effect, etc.<br /><br />BUT This movie was more sincere in its efforts than the first. As a former player of the game, I saw that it held true to many of the game values, and I could relate to the characters and story.<br /><br />The cast did a good job, and it was more of an ensemble performance. Like the first film, I was impressed with their exotic use of Lithuanian film locales.<br /><br />If you've never played the game, you probably won't see it as more than ""typical cheesy fantasy"". For players, it will be a pretty cool experience, and not just a bit o fluff (One character gets killed by a Frost Dragon, another gets her arm teleported into a wall) I have a mixed feeling about the end, since the Hero doesn't ""Get midievel"" on Damodar, but I like that refreshing break from the clichéd final face offs that Hollywood demands to insert into every movie. Our hero is not a wisecracking killing machine. He's strong but just as vulnerable and not just out for revenge.<br /><br />Bruce Payne is an interesting choice to bring in from the first movie, and he handles the role of evil Damodar well, despite having no real motivation outside pure revenge.<br /><br />The chemistry between party members is above average, and they're smart characters, not the typical dumb pretty people. A decent film overall",unsup
11346_0,"I liked the fact Damodar, the only good thing from the first abysmal movie, was the main villain in this one. Someone mentioned that he seemed to be a spellcaster now, but I disagree. I think he was still a Fighter, but he had an artifact that did all sorts of things for him. Also, why did Damodar run from Berek (the Fighter) at the end? My guess is that Berek is a higher level fighter than Damodar (who was put at 7th level in the first movie in Jeff Grubb's adventure adaptation of the movie), and he knew it. I'd run from a higher level fighter too.<br /><br />Things I liked from the movie in no particular oder: we were told about arcane and divine magic, a passing reference to the Barrier Peaks, the god invoked to save the day was Obad-Hai, the Rogue checked for and disarmed traps and picked a lock or two (and used and ancient secret of the Rogues guild at one point...watch carefully for it!), the Rogue palmed a Gem of True Seeing (which saw some good use), LOTS of lightning bolts, a white dragon with the proper breath weapon, the great wyrm black dracolich (The dragon god, but just woke up so he wasn't up to full god power. Shame he breathed fireballs instead of acid streams, but chalk that up to SFX difficulties.), the Rogue burned through a lock with purple worm stomach acid, we had a lich (who was great near the end), wraiths, cloakers, cool traps, a cameo by a pair of dead drow, and Damodar's half-orc toadie.<br /><br />Someone said the cleric pulled a novice move by jumping out and trying to take down the white dragon, but if he hadn't done so, the rest of the party would have been wyrm food too.<br /><br />All in all, it was an entertaining movie and easily the best movie Sci-Fi Productions has ever done.",unsup
11347_0,"This movie is everything that the first movie should have been.<br /><br />I still would have preferred to not have Damodar back, but at least he didn't have blue lipstick this time. Overall, I like the intensity that Bruce Payne brings to his performances, but I still haven't seen a role where he balances that intensity with believability.<br /><br />If you play D&D, you will find moments of every game you've ever played in this movie.<br /><br />I really liked our hero, Sir Baric, and I liked the Barbarian, Lux, and the Rogue. I thought the wizardess was a little weak, as was the cleric.<br /><br />My favorite scene though is one of the closing scenes, where you see the wizardess and the rogue cleaning up the temple of Obad-Hai after receiving major healing there - a really nice gamers' touch I thought.<br /><br />My 6-year old's mouth was hanging open for pretty much the first 10 minutes of the movie, he lost interest once there was a lot of talking, or course, but he really liked the scene where they traverse the tiled floor backwards (a classic D&D staple).<br /><br />I thought that the black dragon-lich looked wonderful, but I would have liked to have seen more about the human lich, and his motivations.<br /><br />An extended DVD version is definitely in order, there were at least 40 minutes of commercials in a 150 minute segment, I would really love to see more of the interactions between the PCs, and more backstory on the Lich, and the council of mages.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best D&D movies yet, although Serenity is pretty close (and it's sci-fi!)",unsup
11348_0,"I am grading on a curve, but this movie was surprisingly good and faithful to the D&D theme. The actors are all unknowns and acquit themselves well, especially Clemency Burton-Hill.<br /><br />This movie is superior in almost every way to the original--the acting is better (none of the overacting of Malcolm McDowell) and the dialogue is decent (cheesy, but not to a ridiculous degree like the original).<br /><br />The best part is how faithful the movie is to D&D concepts like limited spell casting and a Lich controlling Wraiths. And for a $15 million dollar movie (according to IMDb), the producers did a great job of building lavish sets and costumes which give the appropriate mood and texture to the movie (again, in contrast to the fake and cheap sets of the original).<br /><br />The weakest part of the movie were some of the computer effects. Understandable given the budget, but a bit of a distraction, especially since the climax uses a lot of it.<br /><br />Giving this an 8 out of 10 since I'm grading on a scale (this movie was much superior to most direct-to-video or SciFi ""original"" movies).",unsup
11349_0,"For all of those who play DND and have played DND throughout the years... you may have seen a movie that came out in 2000 that you may have hated or maybe even liked what was called Dungeons and Dragons The Movie. Well in my opinion it was a flop... Well recently they actually made a Dungeons and Dragons 2. I watched it last night even though it has not been released yet (it plays on the Sci Fi channel on Oct 8th) and well... it was great! I was totally surprised with the production. It wasn't cheesy (except a few of the special effects) acting wise or production wise. The movie played out like it was a regular adventure that a DM would make up, the spells were cast properly, the ""core"" rules were not broken, and most importantly the characters were interesting and were not INVINCIBLE... they are just like us PC's (getting arms eaten or chopped off or getting eaten whole by a purple worm!). So trust me... it was great. Even though it was obviously lower budget than say... Battlestar Galactica. But what DND game isn't low budget.",unsup
1134_0,"Not really awful but one will always wonder what possessed the immensely talented Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy to make this film together. Maybe it was some sort of a deal or perhaps even a dare.<br /><br />It is immensely familiar to see the opposites in buddy comedy territory but usually there is some kind of twist (think: Lethal Weapon or the original Odd Couple). The difference is in this case is that none of the characters are suicidal.<br /><br />This is not to say that I didn't enjoy some of the moments in here. Levy is incredibly good at playing the nebbish and of course Jackson could do his part in his sleep. There is even a little scene that references some of Jackson's previous work with regards to him using the F-word like he had some kind of reverse V-chip installed within him.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a failed attempt. Even the villain is not all that evil. He seems rather pleasant, except for the fact that he is involved in criminal activity.<br /><br />So, if you absolutely don't have anything else to do, watch this. You will not die laughing but you will be mildly entertained.",unsup

Although there was a clear leader, it was more balanced on a party of characters. It was more of what I would expect from a D&D movie. The action was well paced, and the plot progressed well. The SFX were decent. A few times the CG wasn't that good but it didn't really detract that much. Ellie Chidzley as Lux was very easy on the eyes. Hope to see more of her in the future.<br /><br />In overall context of movies maybe 6.5/10. In the context of a D&D movie and to those looking for one I give it 8/10.<br /><br />Worth a view.",unsup
11351_0,"The first few minutes were the visual equivalent of a bad novel's prologue. Rathern than introducing the problem through the story, the bad guy tells you about himself and his plans, although not in enough specifics for it to make sense. Fortunately, the heroes don't watch the prologue, and they're reasonably good at explaining the plot to the viewers as the movie goes on.<br /><br />The movie did a good job of using D&D terminology (arcane vs. divine magic, etc.) and had the feel of a typical D&D adventure. It was paced fairly well, and the acting was appropriate for an original Sci-Fi channel movie. The special effects were very well done, but some of them weren't too understandable unless you were a D&D player.<br /><br />If you aren't a D&D fan, there's probably not much here for you. If you are, then it's worth watching, as long as you can avoid speculating on what color certain beasts are or complaining that certain things aren't the way they are in the manuals.

But it's 1:45h of real entertainment for any Dungeons & Dragons fan.<br /><br />Unlike the first movie, D&D:Elemental Might go back to the book. Many fantasy movies have wizards and fighters, but I believe the creators actually focused on really bringing the things we recognize from the D&D world into this one. There's a real ""party"" with classic Dungeons & Dragons professions represented and they really do what is to be expected by their roles. There's real dungeons... There's dragons... and there's even a few unique D&D monsters that is recognized from the books. The villain is more evil. The good is more good. There's heaps and heaps of magic, and even divine magic (which is unique to D&D) plays a great role this time around.<br /><br />If you ever played D&D and you can accept some budgetcuts on bringing your fantasy to life, get ahold of this movie. If you never played D&D but you are a general fantasy fan, get this movie because it's the most fantasymovie you have seen since Lord of the Rings. If you are neither a fan of fantasy or an oldtime fan of Dungeons & Dragons, you can probably forget about this one and watch something else.<br /><br />I will buy it and I want to see more D&D movies in the future!",unsup

Despite the poor quality all around of the first one some people gave the source the benefit of the doubt and were willing to try it again. Thankfully this time the source material was taken more seriously and the project was put into better hands.<br /><br />The result is a decent film with a comprehensible story, and decent production quality. The cast is by no means A-list, or even B-list; though they do well in their respective roles. The effects are alright, but if the movie had a better budget it would have been even better.<br /><br />All things being equal this movie is superior to the first. DnD folks out there should like it and appreciate the detail taken to make sure the source material comes through correctly. It's a mixed bag on how much other people will like it.

11354_0,"I was someone that had mixed feelings on the original D&D movie. I thought the script was clunky, the acting was awful as far as good guys were concerned, it contained wildly inappropriate dialog for the setting, and the tone made light of what could have been dramatic events. On the other hand, the movie looked good, had a couple decent fight scenes and the huge Dragon war at the climax was dynamic and exciting. Still, with it's less than impressive reception, I figured this would be a series of one.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when a sequel was announced, and even greater shock when I watched the films premier and found it to be everything I felt it's predecessor lacked. The acting, while not Oscar worthy, was perfectly reasonable work from a handful of unknowns. The plot is treated seriously this time around, with a minimum of cliché and jest (Although there are two laugh out loud moments) and actually features an intelligent foe with a genuinely epic plan for the forces of justice to combat. Speaking of which, the heroes are a nice diverse bunch, and the film manages to showcase each one's unique talents well.<br /><br />As for the action and eye candy, there's plenty. The fights are staged better than 90% of the action flicks on the shelves, with realistic flow and quick pace. The special effects are among the best I've ever seen in a non-theatrical film and are leaps and bounds above any other Sci-Fi premier yet broadcast (Though not quite as good as a theatrical release). The final battle is not as kinetic as the first films finale, but manages to be a fitting climax to the quest.<br /><br />If this is what this crew can produce with a terribly low budget, I say give them 70 million bucks and get Dungeons & Dragons III in theaters ASAP!",unsup
11355_0,"The first D&D movie was largely hated by D&D players, partly because it wasn't a good movie, but also because it was not very much like D&D the game.<br /><br />Perhaps because of the cool reception of the first, this was changed dramatically in the sequel. It now really is like the game, sure to provide lots of geek moments where viewers try to guess which spell is being cast or what magic item is being used. The characters also tend to act like D&D characters, and they actually explore a dungeon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as a movie, it has some shortcomings. For one, much of the acting is uninspired. Not bad, but about a wooden as a dummy of Keanu Reeves. The first movie also suffered from this problem, but in this movie, it's probably because most of the actors are new, this generally being their first film. Exception being Tim Stern, the guy playing the Rogue, who brought some life to his character.<br /><br />The characterization and dialog isn't great, either. Less character development than in some commercials, even though this is a fairly long movie. But I chalk that up also to the inexperience of the screen writers (though also is relatively common in D&D games, so perhaps is a feature, not a bug).<br /><br />When it comes to special effects, they are about on par with Sci-Fi channel offerings. Slightly better. Lord of the Rings it ain't. But not terrible, either.<br /><br />Still, just judging it as a fantasy movie, it's much better than most other low budget ones. Worth watching.

While on it's own it's really only passing fair amongst other films of the genre, it's connections to the original film, and it's remaining true to the spirit of the material from which it was drawn made this movie an enjoyable watch for me. Without giving any spoilers, I would have to say as a D&D'er, this film is much truer to the game then the original movie in every possible way. The character's are more interesting, the perils they face are more dire, the antagonists are clever and deceitful (which is rare in any genre), and their is definitely some decent, though not great, acting.

Fortunately, director Roy Naneau inexhaustibly milks the skimpy premise for every last sensationally shameless, leering, voyeuristic girl-watching cheap sleazy thrill he can derive from the laughably ludicrous story, with the picture hitting its jaw-dropping surreal apex during a wacky nightmare sequence showing two luscious stark naked gals having an Old West-style gunslinger showdown!

But no, this film, and its sequel fails to deliver in that department! Also, Johnny's character of Bruce has lived in the United States since childhood, having immersed himself in American culture for many years, yet he comes-off as a confused tourist who is in the states for the first time? Man, that is about as UNBELIEVABLE as Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) speaking in broken-English, after having lived in the United States (since his teens) for over 50-years!<br /><br />It's interesting that this film still has a following in Australia.

Still, it's not the kind of movie you can genuinely hate, and Johnny Yune is not the most dislikable actor you could find.... (*1/2)",unsup

Johnny Yune is honestly one of the most underrated comedians I have ever seen. Most people may not find it funny, but his style of humor is very funny in this one. Something about the way his character says stuff, just makes for huge laughs. There is no reason to take this movie seriously, because it is just a straight up comedy with a very action parody style plot. Basically seeing this made me want to see a lot more from Johnny Yune, but this was honestly his biggest break in films. So at least give it a try for several cheap laughs. The laughs may be somewhat immature to laugh at, but they are consistent and truthfully very funny.<br /><br />10/10",unsup

11368_0,"Watched at face value, this movie was decent. The jokes were sporadic enough to keep the otherwise monotonous story interesting. As this was a low budget, low production, small time movie, the expectations should not be too high.<br /><br />As for the past comments on stereotypes and lack of plot, this movie was designed to be a spoof of the Bruce Lee/martial arts movies at the time. Yune's character is unable to live up to the stereotypes which have been given to him through Hollywood (eg. Bruce Lee's machismo) and struggles with his identity. As an Asian American, Yune cannot live up to the macho Asian image yet is rejected (possibly as a threat) by the so called ""real"" white Americans.<br /><br />Unlike Hollywood movies, Yune's character is a regular Asian American male, neither hyper-masculine, feminized, asexual (by his many vulgar jokes), or a confused foreigner (Long Duk Dong). Though not overtly pursed, there seems to be some attraction by Pam Huntington's character towards Yune.<br /><br />Yune's character follows no stereotype, and is instead just a regular Asian American male. In the process, he is able to attract the attention of a white female as well as receive an on-screen kiss  something Bruce Lee, Jet Li (as was cut out of Romeo Must Die), and the apparently three dimensional Jackie Chan have all been unable to achieve in mainstream American media. If this movie ever had the chance to become Hollywood, all the above would have been undoubtedly cut.<br /><br />For the movie's failure to live up to preconceived images and stereotypes of males of Asian descent, alone, I give it an 8/10.<br /><br />As for previous comments on how one should not draw conclusions from a comedy movie, one should not draw conclusions from any movie at all.",unsup

1136_0,"Following the old, and sometimes over repeated, Action/Comedy formula THE MAN adds something different to the genre. This combination between the Action Thriller and Comedy was done so many times before but not with a personality like Eugene Levy! He truly is ""the man""! I mean this guy is unique in the way he represents the dumb guy, because he's genuine! No offense to the actor but like is said in the film ""he can't be any dumber than he looks""! He really represents the dumb guy with simplicity, honesty, and mostly, veracity! I think this duet, Samuel L Jackson and Eugene Levy, worked out very well, because they are both excellent actors, and they represent very well the tough and the dumb guy respectively. And the combination of these two character genres, played by these actors, was amazing. At parts it was hilarious (the ""He's my bitch"" scene is remarkable!).<br /><br />THE MAN is essentially action and fun but it also has one or two nice messages either. It's an entertaining film, made in Hollywood standards, but it's a very nice one in the genre.",unsup

11371_0,"Reading some of the reviews here reminds of some critic reviews of various children's movies, wherein they complain about childish plots, low humor or movies that didn't hold their attention, forgetting that they are, in fact, reviewing a children's movie.<br /><br />This movie falls into similar areas, although it's clearly not a children's movie. It is meant to be a spoof, a parody, and it pokes fun at all kinds of people, be they Asian, Caucasian, African-American, Italian, or what have you. It's not meant to be an Oscar candidate. It's meant to be plain silly, slapstick fun. And in that regard, it's perfect.<br /><br />No, Yune looks nothing like Bruce Lee. No, he's not even Chinese. But therein lies the humor. It's as much a send-up of Western stereotypes of Asians as anything (ever watch the ""Average Asian"" skits on MadTV with another Korean, Bobby Lee?).<br /><br />Overall, I have loved this movie every time I've seen it (although the sequel isn't quite the classic), and I would rate it as a fall - out - of - my - seat - and - wet - myself type of comedy.

11374_0,"Children of Glory is supposed to render not just an utterly important event in Hungarian history but also how life tasted in an era of exasperation and unrest. Krisztina Goda's shameful piece succeeds in either of them. While watching the movie my feeling was that this could have been the feeble attempt of a low-rated American director to make a low-cost historical/action flick to be given away as extra DVD supplement of a cheap magazine. An attempt to make something he (or in this case she) has only read a few interesting columns about into a 120-minute feature film. It is also a shame on producer Andy Vajna to have discredited the suicidal courage of the revolutionists by applying his how-to-make-a-stupid-action-packed-blockbuster"" kit while putting Children of Glory together. Sets are inexplicably false, lighting perversely attitudinizing and unrealistic. But what makes me want to cry out loud is that dailogs are entirely out of place, crammed with American common places and hip-hop age jargon that sound more ridiculous than a herd of hippos singing psalms to Billie Jane's melody. And they are cheesy. I am indignant. My only relief is Sandor Csanyi's reliable acting. Not much.",unsup
11375_0,"I love the idea of making a movie to honor 56 and i also love making the story accessible to worldwide audiences. I think the film was executed beautifully, the sets, the costumes, the props, everything fit perfectly, so no problem there.<br /><br />I think the acting was also generally good, Csanyi never disappoints, Gesztesi comes through as always, etc. However, the two lead characters could have done a better job - both Fenyo and Dobo have a difficult time conveying emotions. Fenyo usually looks like a bored android and Dobo - well, whatever.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the inane writing. The plot is just a cheap TV-movie template, predictable, clichéd and often gratuitous. What's even worse is the dialogue. It's comic-book level, sometimes even worse. I was at the point of leaving the theatre after several badly written lines that would have looked out of place even in a high-school essay.<br /><br />Anyways, go see it for the pictures and for the great background story, if you are not familiar with Hungary's shining moment in 20th century history.

It was especially good to see some recent history made into film. It was even-handed politically and I feel it is a must see for everyone! I recently read James Michner's book on the 1956 revolution, so I was pleased to see the movie following the historical accounts very closely. The water polo matches were very believable and incredibly filmed from all angles! I have only seen water polo on TV during the Olympics, but these scenes were gripping. I wondered if the actors were real water polo players. I don't understand why this sport is not more popular in the US. It is fast paced and very grueling physically. Please make a point to see this movie",unsup

I even liked that the movie follows the typical Hollywood building schema which helps the North American population to get into the mood easier and follow the plot. I agree the actors were not always at the top of their game, but this is something easy to overlook with the excellent story leading and the world class visual effects. For me the most important part was the ending of the movie, when the Hungarian national anthem plays (pictures showing to very different places) and I turned to my friend (who is a born Canadian) watching the movie with me: ""You can understand now, why we have tears in our eyes when our national-anthem plays... And he understood.",unsup
11378_0,"I feared this film highlighting one the most dramatic events in modern history would be hampered by bare stage sets and other shortcomings resulting from short funding in Hungary, or the portrayal of events would be marred by national self-pity. It turned out to be nothing short of a well-balanced, historically correct film that arouses great curiosity about what went on in the streets of Budapest (and elsewhere in Hungary) in October and November 1956, and in my mind provokes enormous sympathy for the Hungarian civilians at the time, and the country in general.<br /><br />Director Kata Dobo has had every good reason to use certain elements familiar to commercial ""western"" films. It is an important story that should reach a wider audience. Far too many probably know little or nothing about these events. The Olympic games and the need for love are parallel stories in the film which we all understand, and yet are not melodramatic. <br /><br />This leaves us to grasp just what the turmoil of revolution, secret police reprisals and finally the deaf ear of ""the West"" was about. I can imagine the Hungarians involved in making this film have put their souls into it. The least we can do is to listen this time to what they have to say. The film once over, I can't imagine anyone not getting the message.<br /><br />It is inevitable that a film portraying a revolution without the massive (and often excessive) funding of ""western"" films, can only show examples of key ingredients - the Molotov cocktails, conviction and doubt, Russian brutality, divided loyalties, chaotic emergency services, daredevil teenagers, family divisions, honesty and deception. These true aspects come across not only sufficiently, but well, especially one of the most noteworthy of them: the women at the forefront of the fighting. <br /><br />The modest colouring is in tact with the time, and the mood. The observer is carried from one realistic scene to the another as quickly as the bewildering swiftness of the revolution must have unfolded at the time.<br /><br />At the time, in fear of making the cold war colder, the leaders of the West, with President Eisenhower at the top of the list, support for the Hungarian cry for freedom was shamefully guarded, but as the scenes from the Melbourne Olympics demonstrated, public opinion was not unguarded. This film presents an excellent opportunity for some to recall what really happened in Hungary in 1956, for others a first insight. Luckily the jury of the Berlin international film festival seized the opportunity.",unsup

This film confronts us with questions like 'am I serving my country better by participating in the revolution, or by winning a gold medal at the Olympic games?' Or: 'am I a traitor to my team when I stay in Budapest to fight the Russians?'. Another one: 'do I have a moral obligation to those team-mates for whom water-polo is all they have?'.<br /><br />Apart from this, 'Szabadsag Szerelem' reminds me of the famous 'Dr. Zhivago' from the mid-Sixties. However, I guess this is easy to say for someone without any emotional ties with Hungary. For those who have, I gather that watching this film still can evoke pretty strong emotions.",unsup

To the Hungarian water-polo team playing against their occupiers the Soviet Union in the 1950s, it meant bowing to rough tactics and having no respite at all.<br /><br />Perhaps what took me by surprise, is how rich the production values are for this movie. Like films set against an historical backdrop, such as Black Book, Lust, Caution and the likes, Children of Glory never scrimped at fleshing out the masses who got themselves involved in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, where a simple protest in a university spiralled into armed resistance involving thousands marching through the streets, showing their dissatisfaction of mistreatment by the Russians, and the usual chants of ""Russians Go Home!"".<br /><br />While on a macro level it introduced us to the era of Soviet occupation in most of the eastern Europe bloc, this is essentially also a love story, between a national hero of a water polo player Karcsi Szabo (Ivan Fenyo) and student activist Viki Falk (Kata Dobo). Naturally their relationship doesn't start off smoothly, with a clash of ideals given that Karcsi is in a privileged position for his value to the country in sports, and having more to lose if the status quo is changed. For Viki, it's change that she, and her fellow student leaders, want to initiate, no matter how small their actions are, but soon enough, it became a hydra that went out of control, giving them a little victory, before the big sledgehammer of a retaliation when any typical authoritarian regime respond with their military might.<br /><br />I guess with those in power, and having those who privilege themselves under such conditions, change will always seem threatening, be it to current lifestyles, or fear for their lives. It might appear selfish as demonstrated by Karcsi's mother in self preservation, constantly reminding Karcsi of his duty to win medals for his country, and not to mix with negative influences such as Viki, associated with trouble for her bearing of arms, and being part of the inner circle of the change movement. But we know love can't keep these two apart, right?<br /><br />What made Children of Glory a delight, was besides the scenes of historical value, and its recreation of street battles, it had possibly the first water-polo sports game in a movie I had watched, and filmed it with plenty of excitement that you can't help but to cheer the Hungarian team on as they battle for pride, and for their countrymen's struggles back home, as they meet arch nemesis Russia during the 1956 Melbourne Olympic games, resulting in what was a bloody match in the pool. I thought this segment was very well shot, though you had to really sit through the film to be rewarded for a segment toward the finale.<br /><br />Wonderful acting, rich costumes and sets, together with a blend of history to lend some narrative gravitas, make Children of Glory an excellent movie on many fronts. I like it enough for it to make it to my highly recommended list, and contender for the top 10 movies of the year list.",unsup

Throughout the movie, somehow I never felt that I'm actually in a cinema, and all the two hours went by just like a single moment.<br /><br />Sometimes, I don't like historical movies, because I know what comes next, but here, I never knew what can come in the following spot. The movie is not a history film, not a documentary, it's the story of Viki (Kata Dobo) and Karcsi (Ivan Fenyo) who fall in love in this fast moving always changing setting. We love the smooth lines of Kata Dobo's face, and we are a fan of her not because of her talent - so no complaints here... however, Ivan Fenyo excels throughout the movie and I'm looking forward a lot seeing his next title. Sandor Csanyi brings his usual very good form.<br /><br />The movie is very authentic, all spots filmed at the proper real-life original scenes (buildings, streets), with real-life original guns, tanks, costumes. I guess, this movie must reveal a lot of emotions for people who were part of the revolution of Budapest 1956. (Hungarians raised againt the communist dictatorship, but the Red Army occupied the country and steyed in Hungary until 1990.)<br /><br />As for water-polo scenes, you can expect the best, as all pictures were filmed with the national league of Hungarian water-polo players, a World #1 team!<br /><br />This is a must see for water-polo fans, for people in Central-European studies and all those who have a Hungarian relative.

The director Krisztina Goda and the writers Joe Eszterhas, Éva Gárdos, Géza Bereményi and Réka Divinyi succeed in promoting the Fiftieth Anniversary of the bloody revolution in his country, unknown for many people, through an engaging and full of emotions movie developed in a perfect pace. The dramatic story uses the romance and chemistry of two charismatic characters performed by Iván Fenyö and the gorgeous Kata Dobó associated to sports, more specifically water polo, and a magnificent team of actors, actresses and stunts, to disclose the foregoing historic events. The cinematography, art decoration and costumes give a wonderful reconstitution of Hungry in the 50's, associated to a stunning and touching soundtrack and great special effects.

11383_0,"This film is about the uprising of the citizens in Budapest against the Russians in 1956, and the subsequent symbolic water polo match in the 1956 Olympics.<br /><br />This movie is powerful and words can hardly describe it. From the beginning, the tension between Hungary and USSR is already very visible in the film. Patriotism build up quickly, leading to the uprising of the Hungarians. The initial optimism is portrayed in an effective manner, and the viewers certainly connect wit the characters with their sense of pride and achievement. Though the romance between the leading characters seem to have a weak foundation, the subsequent portrayal is strong. They are willing to risk their own life to protect another.<br /><br />The plot is told in a precise and direct manner. The shooting scenes are highly graphic, possibly to remind the world what terror they have gone through. The persistence of Viki is remarkable. Her efforts in resisting the Russians is brilliantly portrayed, and viewers get to connect with the uprising through her. On one hand, the promise of a free Hungary drives them forward; but on the other hand, the well equipped USSR army showers them with bullets and grenades that obliterates all hope for a brighter future.<br /><br />The final water polo match has such a symbolic meaning. Even though the Hungarians are losing the war, they can beat the enemy in other ways. Hope and glory are invested in the water polo team. Through tight editing, the match is so powerful and breathtaking that my heart pumped with every one of their moves.<br /><br />I particularly find the ending very well done. With the same national anthem, we see the transition from despair in prison to glory in the sports hall. It is such an emotional scene, so intense and so moving.<br /><br />I completely lost count on how many explosions this film has. In fact I think it must be the film with the most explosion scenes I have ever seen. The budget for this film must have been astronomical.<br /><br />From my Hungarian friend, the movie is historically accurate. Is it right to die for a glorious cause? As this film points out at one juncture, ""He didn't die for the country. He died because he was killed by a machine gun"". This film is thought provoking. Are freedom fighters pursuing an impossible dream? Have they given up their lives for nothing? This is an exceptionally powerful film. It is compelling, touching and the most importantly, crystallises the spirit of the humankind's desire for freedom. It easily becomes one of my favourite films in recent years.",unsup

After the conquest of this revolution with the help of Soviets a tragic new dictatorship fell over my fatherland for another 33 years which was full with lying and falsification of history. It was terrible to survive this period. Unfortunately the Western countries did not give any help to overcome the Soviet aggressors, although in their feeling they sympathized with our revolution. This film gives some kind of gratification for all of these sad decades. It clearly shows that the truth and the moral victory was on the side of Hungarian revolutionists. Maybe therefore our present post-communist government is not so pleased with this film because they feel that their predecessors played a very brutal role in our history.",unsup

It was particularly timely with the riots this year in the streets of Budapest.

I never appreciated her - never saw any movie where she didn't pose in lingerie - but after this I have to say, she has to run around in lingerie because in clothes, there's nothing touching in her, nothing that makes you believe what she says, no emotions on her face whatever. She cannot act, that's it.<br /><br />But the movie had so many strong appearances and so many talented people behind the cameras, that you easily forget about Dobó. <br /><br />Iván Fenyö; is no surprise, he's been in the Jake Gyllenhal movie Jarhead before (which I didn't like though), and he can act. He's enjoyable here, not his best and not the best in the movie though.<br /><br />Károly Gesztesi is phenomenal in his role as the coach, one of the most likable characters here. The other of the greatest performances is brought by Sándor Csányi. He's well-known for his leading role in Kontroll, and he simply outshines everyone here as well. The leading lady - after Dobó's failure - is surely Viki Szávai, Eszter in the movie (Dobó's best friend). She's playing so easily you can believe she's not even playing, it's her true self... I liked the character so much thanks her playing that the loss of her was one of the saddest moments for me though it was almost obvious what has to happen to her.<br /><br />Vic Armstrong did a great job with what he had... The few tanks and other limitations didn't stop him to recreate what was happening on the streets of Budapest. You'll be scared by thinking it through, it's so real...<br /><br />Kriszta Goda's second movie direction here makes you need to see the first as well. She did an amazing job here.<br /><br />After all, I was touched, and touched is such a cliché when talking about this movie and the story behind it.<br /><br />1956 means something for everyone who has at least a little percentage of Hungarian blood in his/her veins... either you were here afterwards and saw the aftermath, either you live here now as young and have the same needs, feelings for freedom, or you're living abroad and were raised on stories about Hungary and how your family had to live, run through the border while they were shooting at them... Or you've heard about the story, you know someone who's Hungarian. Or even reading about it here, and seeing this movie it'll change you a little bit, in what you think about Hungary. I hope less people will laugh at those cheap jokes by comedians on the US national TV after seeing this little history lesson.<br /><br />No matter how many stories you've heard it's not like being there and seeing this movie will bring you back as a watcher, you'll understand them more and appreciate them more. After leaving the theater you'll surely believe the people who died on the streets or in the AVO prisons were true heroes. Makes you feel the need to do something patriotic as well...<br /><br />Thus I hope everyone of you goes out to see it, internationally. After so many touching movies about American history, here's your chance to see how those in the Eastern block struggled and fought for their lives.

Despite the enormous talents of both actors, they can't do a thing to save this dull, unoriginal buddy cop flick. Many of the gags fall flat and simply go nowhere. For example, in one part Levy is hungry and wants to get something to eat. Jackson suggests they get a burger, but Levy doesn't want to, because red meat doesn't agree with his stomach. The pay-off to the gag? He passes gas in the car. God, it must've taken hours to come up with that punchline! The characters are totally clichéd and one-dimensional. Levy's job is to ramble on about banalities, while Jackson's job is to roll his eyes at him. The film does nothing to distinguish itself amongst the buddy-cop genre. Come on, we went from ""48 Hours"" to this? Unfortunately, this is Levy's first starring role since he became a household name with his role in the ""American Pie"" films. Hopefully, he'll stumble upon much better roles than this in the future. His deadpan comic style is hilarious, as we've seen in the ""AP"" trilogy, but in ""The Man"" he's forced to be an obnoxious fool. Levy's talent is more in reacting to awkward situations than creating awkward situations. Samuel L. Jackson looks completely embarrassed to be associated with the film. He probably took on this role so he can fulfill his contract of 50 movies a year. Jackson is undoubtedly one of our most talented actors, but at the same time not the most choosy with his roles. Plus, in the movie he's forced to play the usual ""angry black guy"" character he has played in every other movie. So it really is like watching DeNiro playing a gangster. And to top it all off, Jackson and Levy seem to share no chemistry.<br /><br />""The Man"" is yet another lame PG-13 comedy. You remember the days when producers couldn't give two s**ts about earning the PG-13 rating? You don't even have to go that far back. Look at ""My Cousin Vinny."" Now, in place of that, we have watered down comedies like the ""Legally Blonde"" flicks. An ""R-rating"" probably wouldn't have made ""The Man"" a much better comedy, but the PG-13 comedy seems to be a epidemic nowadays. I think if producers would have the guts to be more edgy and go against the studio's wishes to submit a film with a PG-13, we'd probably have a lot more funny comedies.",unsup

11394_0,"The Red Tent chronicles the series of polar disasters beginning with the crash of the dirigible piloted by Italian General Umberto Nobile trying to make a historic air crossing of the North Pole. Nobile is played by Peter Finch in this epic film that unfortunately due to a bad publicity campaign and an indifference to the subject by western audiences made this historic Russian-Italian jointly produced film a financial disaster.<br /><br />That's a pity because photographically it's one of the finest things ever put on celluloid stock. There are some absolutely breathtaking shots of the frozen tundra and the performances of the actors battling the elements are first rate. Maybe a straight narrative might have been better instead of having the aged Nobile confronting some angry spirits of the past. Nobile was still alive when this film came out, he would die in 1978 still a figure of controversy. The dream with the angry spirits is a device frankly ripped off from George Bernard Shaw's St. Joan.<br /><br />Maybe the film could be best compared to William Wellman's Island in the Sky that starred John Wayne. The fictional characters there are mostly rescued and held together by Duke's leadership. Of course some thirty years advance in aviation and no political interference helped Wayne's men. And Island in the Sky is a work of fiction.<br /><br />Maybe it wouldn't be so if men of science could simply be men of science without answering to competing ideologies. Nobile and his men got caught up in the politics of the time. Politics claimed a lot of their lives and the lives of Roald Amundsen and party who vanished in a rescue attempt. <br /><br />Nobile also made some bad choices and had some bad choices forced on him by Mussolini's fascist government. He was also a man out of his element, he was great aviation pioneer, but not a polar explorer. He paid with his reputation, some of his party paid with their lives.<br /><br />Sean Connery has a small role as Roald Amundsen and I wish we had more of him here. Finch has a very effective scene with Claudia Cardinale the widow of one of his men where she takes him to task. Hardy Kruger does a fine job as the aviator presenting Finch with a very disagreeable choice.<br /><br />I'd recommend seeing it, but only on the big screen. Or definitely in a letter box version. The formatted VHS I have definitely hampers the spectacle.",unsup
11395_0,"atching THE RED TENT gave me that rare fulfillment and dramatic wholesomeness one can only get from a stonecold classic, a CITIZEN KANE or a ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Granted it doesn't compare to these or other heavily praised list toppers and film behemoths, mainly due to questions of style and cinematic pioneering (or lack thereof as the case may be), it still deserves more than the meagre 500 votes and 6.6. rating it has here.<br /><br />As far as I can tell the story is faithful to the real events that transpired in 1928 during and after General Nobile's first attempted expedition to the North Pole by air. His airship (zeppelin), 'Italia', was forced to abandon its mission due to forbidding weather conditions and return home. On the way back it was shipwrecked on the ice somewhere 100 miles away from its base at Kingsbay island and the handful of survivors that weren't blown away with the keel were forced to carve a meagre, frostbitten existence as they waited for rescue parties. Three years earlier famous polar explorer Roal Amundsen had flown over the Pole using another of Nobile's airships, the 'Norge', and it was the subsequent fight for who deserved the most credit (engineer, explorer or airship pilot) that led to Nobile's fateful expedition with 'Italia'. The amount of bad luck involved in that expedition, the one month the survivors huddled together in the freezing arctic wasteland waiting for rescue, and the mishaps that plagued rescue parties, in both air and sea, is staggering to think. To watch it all unravel in 2 hours makes for a haunting experience.<br /><br />You don't need to trawl Wikipedia for info on the events before sitting down to watch the movie. The first few minutes consist of very tastefully done 'period' footage of Nobile's expeditions, as the aged general watches newsreels of the events on a TV. After all these years Nobile (Peter Finch) is still plagued by guilt, slowly eroding his soul with questions he can't possibly answer. But the dead can and it's their authority to judge him. And so Nobile invokes them in his living room, figments of his guilt-crazed imagination, the dead imperative personified as nemesis divina. People that died and people that survived are summoned by and in Nobile's mind to absolve or condemn him for his actions. The old general coping with his guilt and from these discussions the bulk of the story unfolds in the form of long flashbacks.<br /><br />Needless to say that if you have even a remote interest in polar explorations (or any kind of explorations really, as all of them, from the old west to the moon, are but retreads on the same path) and generally survival adventures on harsh environments, this is a must see. Unlike Scott's fateful expedition in the South Pole however, the tragic end here remains internalized, mostly taking place inside Nobile's soul as he finds himself unjustly branded a coward and deserter upon his return. But the stark nature of the windblasted arctic landscape and the men trying beyond all hope to survive in it offers its fair share of physical bleakness.<br /><br />This Italorussian co-production spared no corners in the budget. This is a lavish production with hundreds of extras, an icebreaker ship tearing through the ice and some truly breathtaking photography shot on location (or some location that passes for the North Pole at least, Siberia must be full of 'em). With an international cast that includes Peter Finch (capturing the anguish and despair at the heart of the protagonist without resorting to the overbearing histrionics that earned him the Oscar in '77 over DeNiro's Travis Bickle), Claudia Cardinale (without doubt the most astonishingly beautiful woman on the planet in the late 60's), Sean Connery (in a small role as Roald Amundsen) and Mario Adorf (familiar face from many Italian b-movies), a rousing score by maestro Ennio Morricone, and sturdy direction by Mikhail Kalatozov (five years after I AM CUBA), this really is a lost classic any way you slice it up and just a great f-cking movie.<br /><br />As much a poignant character study on guilt and memory (Nobile needs only his own forgiveness in the end and it's his memory that punishes him a thousand times for things out of his control), as it is a stark piece of survival grit, THE RED TENT deserves a larger audience. You be it.",unsup
11396_0,"Arctic climes didn't do Sean Connery's initially troubled post-Bond career any favours, although his top billing in The Red Tent is highly misleading, since his supporting role is not much more than a cameo. Instead, forth-billed (after Claudia Cardinale and Hardy Kruger) Peter Finch takes the lead as General Nobile, whose ill-fated 1928 airship expedition to the North Pole, intended to boost Fascist Italy's international prestige, instead ended ingloriously with the survivors stranded on melting ice packs for weeks while inertia, lack of initiative and the poor chain of command resulted in buck-passing, recriminations and destroyed reputations rather than rescue attempts. The real-life disaster was the inspiration for Frank Capra's Dirigible (Capra and studio boss Harry Cohn were both huge admirers of Mussolini in the early days), but this ambitious Russian-Italian co-production is best remembered, if at all, for either its catastrophic box-office failure or its unusual framing structure. Although unusual may be an understatement: in a move more akin to theatre of the 60s rather than epic cinema, it begins with the ageing Nobile, tormented by another sleepless night, summoning up the ghosts of those involved in the disaster and the rescue to put his command on trial.<br /><br />As a dramatic device, it's too theatrical to entirely work, especially in the clumsy opening reel, but it impinges little on the main drama once the film gets going and ultimately pays dividends, both in the stark poetry and terrible beauty of a scene where Connery's Roald Amundsen recounts his own death and in the final moments which come to some kind of peace with the issues of responsibility, human fallibility and forgiveness. But it's the survival story that works best, with director Mickail K. Kalatozov often eschewing the spectacle (airship and plane crashes, icebreakers and vast landscapes of ice) with a preference for medium shots that keep the film surprisingly intimate (unusually for such an expensive picture, it is also shot in the more confined 1.78:1 ratio rather than Scope).<br /><br />I can't answer for its historical accuracy beyond Connery's philosophical Amundsen being nothing like the ruthless egomaniac of reality that he had become by this time (indeed, Amundsen's death in this rescue did much to salvage his heroic reputation after the public backlash to his bitter score-settling memoirs). However, far from having to be persuaded to join the rescue attempts, Amundsen had immediately volunteered only for Mussolini to specifically insist he be excluded because of his earlier public disputes with Nobile in the aftermath of their previous expedition, leaving Amundsen to finance his rescue attempt privately. Nor was Amundsen reluctant to return to the Arctic: shortly before the opportunity arose, he said that he wanted to go back and die there ""in the fulfilment of a high mission, quickly, without suffering."" (The fact that he was undergoing painful radium treatment at the time may have colored his words.) Poetic license aside, it is surprising that the political fallout is not dealt with more overtly - it was a huge national embarrassment that Il Duce's heroes had to be rescued by Russian communists. Indeed, the film is almost totally apolitical, with Il Duce mentioned only once in passing in the opening newsreel footage. However, as a drama it's unsensationally compelling, and Ennio Morricone's score is one of his best.<br /><br />Paramount's widescreen R1 DVD transfer is pretty good but sadly lacking in any extras.",unsup
11397_0,"This Italian-Russian endeavor is a lost treasure and one of the great historical dramas. The movie is really a dream of General Nobile, a survivor and commanding officer of the Italia, a dirigible that met with disaster in a grand Artic exploration during the Mussolini era. It is about the psychology of guilt, accountability, and leadership. Beyond the human psychological profile of the film, it captures the harsh, expansive grandeur of nature better than almost any movie I've seen. The cinematography of the Artic is unlikely to be ever met again with the computer-generated film of today. The Russian ice-breaker ship which rescues the Italian crew survivors requires no special effects and remains a challenge for today's movie producers to emulate. Sean Connery, Claudia Cardinale, Peter Finch and the rest of the cast give very fine acting performances. Ennio Morricone composes one of his greatest scores. As great as a film composer he is, he still is not remembered for one of his most haunting compositions in this film. It is a shame this film was not recognized perhaps in part due to its Russian influence in a Hollywood-dominated market. It is a bit rough around the edges (meaning editing and directing could be smoother) but in terms of great film-making, it rarely gets better. When you watch it a couple times, you begin to appreciate the beauty and human drama of this film.",unsup
11398_0,"Since viewing this film 35 years ago I have been in awe of it, it is certainly my all-time favorite and would most likely get my nomination for best film ever. On this point I probably stand in splendid isolation (or to quote Finn Malmgren: ""emptiness, loneliness, beauty, and purity""). I mention this in the hope that this will encourage readers to view the film. If you are seeking a comparison, ""Krasnaya Palatka"" (""The Red Tent"") is most like the original ""Flight of the Phoenix""; both are superficially action adventure films, with deep allegorical elements about the dynamics behind the functioning of a civilized society. ""The Red Tent"" even gets a little philosophical along the lines of life as a journey and not a destination.<br /><br />This is Director Mikheil Kalatozishvili's tribute to Sergei Eisenstein, a disorienting yet organized montage of vast scale juxtaposed with claustrophobic confinement (its worth watching again just to focus on the scene transitions-the editing is brilliant). The scenes inside the dirigible and the red tent (the title character) are carefully cut into spectacular exterior shots of arctic landscapes and the dynamic energy of crowds in the Russian countryside and city. <br /><br />There is a fusion of European expressionism with Hollywood realism in this film unlike anything I have ever seen before. This is possible because of the storytelling device of having everything unfold in flashbacks by the main character General Nobile (Peter Finch). Nobile was the organizer and commander of Italy's ill-fated attempt to reach the North Pole by dirigible. This generally true (certain historical liberties are taken to simplify things) story is told entirely from his point of view. <br /><br />Forty years after the expedition Nobile is a disgraced figure living in Rome and burdened by guilt and sleeplessness. You learn that on sleepless nights he conjures up participants in the expedition fiasco (both members and rescuers), letting them judge him for his actions 40 years ago. These sessions have been largely inconclusive but this night he pulls out all stops and convenes a full trial in his living room-with almost all the central figures present. More importantly, for the first time he names the ruthless Lundborg (Hardy Kruger) as his prosecutor-a move that Lundborg assures him will mean that the jury will reach a verdict for the first time. These are not ghosts but rather figments of Nobile's imagination and they behave according to his perception of how they would behave. <br /><br />This storytelling device allows the film to have its own commentary, making it not just an exciting adventure film with wonderful visuals, but an examination of the concept of leadership (much like ""Command Decision"", ""A Gathering of Eagles"", and ""They Came to Cordura""). More importantly it becomes an allegorical study about free will and destiny, as careful planning and good judgment are just two factors in any complex operation; subject to luck and unforeseen events.<br /><br />The many characters are a representative cross section of society; with heroes, opportunists, martinets, dreamers, and average Joes. Ultimately, things happen (both good and bad) not because of the challenge of man versus nature, but because of the placement and misplacement of human resources (i.e. the right or wrong person assigned to a particular role in the expedition and the rescue efforts). <br /><br />From the events portrayed in the ""The Rent Tent"" it is difficult to fault Nobile as a leader. He wisely turns back to Kings Bay when the weather gets bad, he is genuinely devastated at the loss of some of his men, and his actions after the crash are all reasonable. He can be blamed for allowing Lundborg to bring him out before his men but under the circumstances it was a sensible decision if not a politically correct one. As Samoilovich, Captain of the Russian Icebreaker Krassin points out, a leader is judged by their actions, and their actions by their results, Nobile's early rescue is the reason the other surviving crewmen are ultimately rescued.<br /><br />Nobile's fantasy trial eventually dredges from his subconscious the realization of why he choose to leave with Lundborg (1000 reasons to stay-1001 to leave). That such a trivial and self-indulgent reason was the difference maker accounts for his continuing guilt. This realization, along with the belief that Amundsen (his peer) is the only one fit to judge him, allows Nobile to finally forgive himself for being human. They go out with Amundsen's advice to reflect not on their failures but on the things they attempted and the wondrous things they saw. There is no guilt in not achieving an ambitious goal, making the attempt is more important than succeeding. <br /><br />The music is also great.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",unsup
11399_0,"""The Red Tent"", as it was called when released in most of the world, is a fascinating historical epic of Arctic exploration. In the 1920's, Italian General Nobile sought to be the first to fly over the North Pole in a dirigible, of all things! Much of the movie focuses on these efforts; unfortunately, the winds kick up and the air ship is ripped apart. Surviving crewmen end up in various locations on the ice and then procede to battle the elements and polar bears. The great arctic explorer Raoul Amundsen is called in as are the Soviets who pick up radio messages of the disaster; an ice breaker is then dispatched to assist in the rescue. Yes, it is an involved and realistiuc spectacle.<br /><br />Peter Finch is very good as Nobile, and so is Connery as Amundsen - and it's an historic well-known fact that the first man to reach the South Pole, Amundsen, vanished in his attempt to save Nobile.<br /><br />Of note is that the story is recounted in flashback much later in a sort of trial of Nobile in his home in Rome, as characters living and dead appear to confront or defend him. Whether or not Nobile was reckless or had bad luck, or just over reached himself, is for the viewer to determine from putting the stories together.<br /><br />Somewhat long and overinvolved this is still an engrossing account of an epic Arctic disaster and the heroic rescue attempts that followed.

(There are a few other, smaller h.e. moments too, like when Levy checks out Jackson's back tattoo, and is there some sort of subtext with all the talk about being shot in the butt?)<br /><br />The movie itself is poorly directed, blandly photographed, and the illegal-gun-running plot would be confusing if either the audience or the writer cared. And Sam Jackson's I.A. agent character was really unpleasant some of the time. Are we supposed to like him, or at least think he's a good cop? I dunno.

He enjoys the show and asks for another attraction; Lionel convinces Carmen to wear a veil and perform another song and introduces her to Steve as the French singer Mademoiselle Fifi.

11400_0,"Asked to give his assessment of Umberto Nobile's leadership in the Italia airship disaster of 1927, his friend and colleague, Samoilovich, offers this sage advice, ""Men are judged by their actions and their actions by their success"". What exactly are the qualities needed for leadership? ""The Red Tent"" is a wonderful meditation on that question. At the time Nobile was disgraced, he was accused of abandoning his men, and made a scapegoat for the disaster by Benito Mussolini's Fascist government. Forty years after the event his rest is still disturbed by doubts he has about the leadership he exercised. Could the tragedy have been averted? Was it his vanity to be the first to cross the pole by air, that led to the calamity? These and other questions are tackled in this thoughtful film. <br /><br />The entire film actually takes place in the General's mind. He calls back various participants to the event, to re-live what happened, and ultimately to pass judgment on him. It is this framing device that makes the film unique, for it examines Nobile's leadership from a divergent points of view, allowing the viewers to make their own judgment as well. It is a theatrical device to be sure, but it works in this film. In time we come to learn that truth often walks on two legs and has a left and right hand. ""Yet we must have judgment"", says one of the participants, and so they do. These scenes which all take place in Nobile's apartment in Rome with it's warmth and comfort, provide a wonderful contrast to the stark reality of the struggle for survival at the Arctic Pole.<br /><br />The film is beautifully written and the acting is of a high level throughout. Sean Connery, ridding himself of his Bond image, plays Roald Amundsen, the great Arctic explorer at the end of his days. It is Amundsen who exemplifies the qualities a great leader should have. It is the first and in some ways still the best of Connery's wise old man performances. He is also the one participant Nobile has most conspicuously not brought back. After intruding on the proceedings like some force of nature, he describes how he had reached the wreak of the Italia, only to crash land and be stranded. With nothing to do but wait to freeze to death he finds solace in his final moments of life with a book he has found strewn among the wreckage. The cynical Lundborg scornfully rejects this ""final touch"" as ""theatrical"" ""But who would I be acting for?"" Amundsen asks. ""Yourself"" Lundborg replies. ""But that isn't acting,"" Connery wisely replies, ""That's necessary. The trick is to choose the right part."" The film is filled with great lines like this. Claudia Cardinale, as Nurse Valaria, provides the emotional center of the film. She resents the good people of King's Bay capitalizing on the disaster, yet she has no misgivings whatever in playing on Amundsen's sense of guilt to get him to mount a rescue attempt. After all he had introduced her lover, the Meteorologist, Finn Malgrem to Arctic exploration. She is also willing to offer herself to Lundborg if he will risk his life to fly in unsafe weather conditions. It is her bitter confrontation with Nobile after he has been safely brought back to King's Bay while the others were left freezing on the ice, that is the beginning of his sleepless nights. His inability to stop Zampi, his ambitious second in command from leaving the red tent with Mariano and Malgrem in a vain attempt to reach help, would result in the Meteorologist being lost on the ice. ""You cracked like the ice."" she tells the General. ""We shall never meet again I hope. And I hope you never forget."" He doesn't. <br /><br />Peter Finch as Nobile carries the film, and he is in every way up to the task. He manages to convey the intelligence, courage, vanity and despair of this self-doubting individual. He is a man who both admires Amundsen and resents always being compared with him. Hardy Kruger plays the dashing Aviator Lundborg with a nice blend of charm and hard edge cynicism. He is the first to reach the survivors. His motives for rescuing the Nobile over the General's objections that he take the other members of his expedition first, some of whom are badly injured, may have been less than admirable, but it is this act that will ultimately save the others. Lundborg finally persuades the General to go with a combination of threats,(he will leave him and the others behind), reassurance,(six quick trips and it will be over), and finally reason, (the General is badly needed at King's Bay to organize the rescue). The others also agree the General must go. It is only when he is safely back at King's Bay, that he realizes his actions have been badly misconstrued as an act of desertion. By that time weather conditions have changed again and it is impossible to go back and rescue the others by air. ""What do they think I've done?"" he asks Captain Romagna, the ineffectual rescue coordinator, after reading a cable from Rome placing him under arrest. ""They think you have done what you have done, I suppose."" Romagna lamely replies. While aboard ship, Nobile radios his friend Samoilovitch to use the icebreaker Krassin to rescue the others. This he does. ""Men are judged by their actions and their actions by their success."" The General's decision to leave his men led to his being able to radio the Krassin which in turn led to the rescue of his men. ""His actions, therefor were correct.""<br /><br />Lastly, Ennio Morricone's lush score captures both the romance of a great endeavor being undertaken and the desolate, ethereal beauty of the Arctic. This film deserves to be seen and heard, and one can only hope that one day it will be restored.",unsup

11402_0,"This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story.<br /><br />Here we have the revolution being ""rumored"" in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her.<br /><br />This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland.",unsup
11403_0,"A Russian baron evades the violent SCARLET DAWN of the Revolution by escaping Moscow with his faithful serving maid.<br /><br />Here is an excellent little film, from Warner Bros. and director William Dieterle, full of excitement, drama and pre-Code libidinousness. The production values--sets, costumes, score--are all first rate and the acting is of a high quality. The picture's only major drawback is its too-brief conclusion, perhaps necessitated by its short overall running time of under an hour, but this does not explain why the film should be so unjustly obscure today. It is a small gem awaiting discovery by viewers appreciative of quality cinema.<br /><br />Douglas Fairbanks Jr is properly dashing as the young nobleman whose life is suddenly tilted upside down by the political upheaval. The actor revels in giving a full-bodied portrayal, presenting a character both wantonly licentious and daringly brave. The sequence in which he dashes into the streets of Constantinople in search of Christian witnesses to his impromptu wedding is delightful in its unexpected sense of frolic & fun. Fairbanks is ably matched by Nancy Carroll, deftly underplaying her role as his adoring servant. The sweetness of her character's simple nature shines through, as well as a steely resolve, as she endures dangers and hardships to be with the man she loves.<br /><br />Lovely Lilyan Tashman, in one of her final roles before her early death, plays the scheming Russian courtesan who hopes to use Fairbanks as her ticket to the good life in Paris. Guy Kibbee, a very popular character actor at Warner's, appears for only a few moments at the end of the movie as a wealthy American visiting the Levant.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Mischa Auer as a Russian cavalry officer; beefy Dewey Robinson as a Bolshevik thug; nervous Frank Reicher as a duplicitous pawnbroker; as well as Mae Busch & Lee Kohlmar as the wedding witnesses--all uncredited.",unsup
11404_0,"While I don't understand how in 1932 a movie could be made sympathizing with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, I do understand that Scarlet Dawn is a pre-Code film. Like most movies made between 1928 and 1934 (six of the best years in moviemaking, if you ask me), the lighting, sets, and photography are flawless. The print that is on video has perfect sound and picture quality. The costumes are delightfully ornate. Doug Jr. as Nikita Krasnoff is perfect, probably because he was the only actor on the Warners lot in 1932 with enough sex appeal to get away with what he got away with in the movie (i.e. sexual harassment). Nancy Carroll is his faithful servant and, later on in the film, wife. Lilyan Tashman plays a gossipy, scheming, glamour-gal mistress. While Lil and Nan sort of steal the show, their talents are slightly wasted. It's Doug who really captivates throughout, and considering how absolutely luscious he looks, the already short movie (just under an hour) flies by effortlessly. Scarlet Dawn is underrated, but extremely interesting, and the vintage 1917 war footage is a cute touch.",unsup

11406_0,"Clint Eastwood stars as Wes Block a police officer who hunts a serial killer who targets prostitutes who he handcuffs. However Eastwood finds it hard to be a police officer in the red light district because his urges get the better of him. Some good acting from Eastwood and Bujold elevate this one above mediocrity, but some interest still remains especially since the serial killer plot angle offers some good ideas.",unsup
11407_0,"Clint Eastwood plays the typical tough cop this time around in New Orleans but has secrets. What starts as an interesting crime case and a question of Clint's character drags into an overlong boring venture as the same thing that happens at the beginning continues after 90 of the 115 minutes. TIGHTROPE may add a new dimension to the typical Clint Eastwood character, but it is anything but beneficial.<br /><br />A girl from the red light district is murdered. As night cop and detective, but supporting single father of two, Wes Block is on the case, but his weaknesses may also tie into the murder as the bodies are starting to pile up.<br /><br />Exploring the dark side of human nature is a natural thing in Hollywood. A cop on the edge as much as Block is is a basic and easy way to convey the message. Very little to no artistic quality or direction in TIGHTROPE. The dark settings and scenery are reminiscent stuff of the early 80s (THE TERMINATOR, BLADE RUNNER). If TIGHTROPE was far more straight to the point instead of a terrible bore, it might be a bit more watchable than it is.",unsup
11408_0,"I love this movie, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. It's a very dark, mysterious movie set mostly at night. Within the adult scene in 80's New Orleans. With Clints character's sexual cravings he begins to cross the killers domain and realises the killer is not only very much in touch with him, but similar to his desires in many ways. It's a great story, simple stalker type movie but done superbly. Twists and turns throughout the film. It's a forgotten or perhaps not known very well Eastwood gem, not a dirty harry shoot em up though, a more dark, personal film involving Clints life orientating between father to his girls and his seedy sexual desires in the night of New Orleans, to his non stop crusade to bring a dark and mysterious stalker to justice. A wonderful film, great acting and suspense throughout. Very enjoyable. 10 out of 10",unsup
11409_0,Dirty Harry film that is a n improvement on th enforcer. The company bucked up there ideas probably as the previous film dragged on due to slow plotting and style of filming which was popular in the 70's to try to suggest to mean something. This time the story and pacing are tighter and sharper. A new device is presenting him with a family which shows his character with a more humane side and also gives greater responsibility which makes him more vulnerable to the killer he is pursuing. This vulnerability is a contrast to his usual invincibility as a loner who has nothing to lose if he is killed. With a family to care for his every action must be taken with this responsibility in mind and a killer is able to manipulate this vulnerability. This same vulnerability makes Eastwood's character stronger as he is must take into account this personal duty as well as his police duty.,unsup

11410_0,"Hard to fault a Clint Eastwood movie; he is so versatile. Interesting to see his daughter Allison at such a young age, as previously the only thing i ever saw her in was ""Midnight in the Garden of Good an Evil"", which he put together around a set of Johnny Mercer songs. Interesting to see him so young too; he looks like a kid in this movie. Also cool to see New Orleans in the 80's, ""pre-Katrina""..Pretty risqué for an ""80's"" movie; lots of nudity for such an old movie. The one thing i didn't like about it was that it was so dark; a lot of it was filmed at night or in the cat houses. Also after seeing current ""CSI"" shows regularly, it does seem a little primitive in their investigative methods.",unsup
11411_0,"Richard Tuggle's got plenty of ambition in his script, but for some reason he actually fares even better as a director. He tries to mix around maybe too much in his way of making a dark psychological thriller for his star, Clint Eastwood, but there's at least some very interesting set-ups he puts together in the middle of all the constant ""crime scene"" scenes (and there are MANY in this film, probably too much unless a fan of CSI). On the one hand, Tightrope tells the story of a divorced father of two girls who, as he says, are the only two things he hasn't screwed up. He's also into really getting into his work, i.e. going into the red-light districts of New Orleans and finding prostitutes at night. This comes out of the other story, which is about a serial killer who only kills women- said prostitutes and other ladies of the night- and leaves a red ribbon and some saliva as his only markers. This latter one, in all actuality, isn't even the story with more interest, even though that's the one most fans of Eastwood and of serial killer movies will want to see. On that end, Tuggle just pulls through with adequate marks, albeit with nothing too wrong or stupid to make it unbearable.<br /><br />But this storyline does provide an intersection into the one with Eastwood's Detective as he becomes embroiled in this case up to his neck- or groin maybe- and it's fascinating seeing Eastwood in such a sexually charged thriller for once, not to mention without the tongue-in-cheek lines and machismo turned to 11. He's a working cop with more than his share of flaws, but he loves his kids and tries to go at his job as a professional, and Eastwood plays him that way, but in doing this, and in the typical love interest angle that develops ever so subtly with a sex crimes expert, there's some complexities here. Tuggle provides some of the freshest psychological thrills I've seen in any neo-noir, either in just atmosphere (Eastwood walking through a warehouse filled with carnival-like animatronics, very nightmarish) or in how his perceptions of the case get to his head (a dream scene where he's the killer sounds too easy, but Tuggle isn't out to make it easy for him). When it starts to get personal, as the killer goes after the Detective, there's even an effective moment when Eastwood finally cracks through emotionally, and one realizes what's under all of that intense, cynical gruff. Meanwhile, Tuggle doesn't stop as a director in giving this about as dark a look as possible, and with the sexuality, while sleazy (where else will you see women wrestling all oiled up and refereed by a midget named Shorty), is also effective for the mood.<br /><br />All of this makes for some intriguing viewing, in many parts, however the more standard parts of the plot, the kind that may or may not bring some who want to seek out Eastwood's more obscure starring vehicles, lack the spark of what's unexpected. Eastwood's scenes with his own kid, Alison, are part of the intrigue. When we see them in very down-to-earth moments where the ex-wife/mother, a distant figure in this New Orleans world, pops up there's some things that don't need to be said, but get conveyed anyway. How much is there truth-wise in this for the real father/daughter dynamic, or is it just for show by a consummate professional and his equally apt offspring? I can't say for sure, but it makes for what might make for a better movie, if only the red-ribbon killer angle got some extra lift. That's not to say Tuggle doesn't end it on a high-note for thriller-fans, including a big laugh at what happens at the end of the train tracks tussle.",unsup
11412_0,"Interesting premise, the ""tightrope"" all people walk between normal life and their darker sides. But there is no real script. There is no plot, and the whole disjointed mess needs to be edited down so that it can make sense. Poorly written and clumsily executed. Who was that guy at the end? We just see a pair of runners all movie, and the end, he's revealed as the killer but who the hell was he? Bujold's character was awful, a ball breaking man hater who swoons for Clint's misogynistic sweaty balls as he exercises hovering his crotch in her face at the gym. His ""I wanna lick the sweat off your body"" line delivered over oysters in his ""Go Ahead, make my day"" inflection set her heart and panties aflame. Yeah, that happens a lot. It would have been a better film if Clint WERE the killer. Then we'd have a person in a responsible job, maintaining the facade of an upright father in order to hide his violent kink. Very poor writing throughout. The choking severed arm at the end is just icing on a half baked idea. There's a lot of nudity delivered in a very dark and nasty feeling style, so that's a plus for the film, but the whole film needed a writer and an editor.",unsup
11413_0,"A terribly conventional thriller that dilutes Dirty Harry with two parts Hitchcock and forty parts nighttime New Orleans. The story is so thin you can strain jam through it and is padded out with a couple of tension-building sequences. One, during evening Mardi Gras is partially effective but the others are simply padding, chase sequences.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is as ever, although he seems rather restrained. This may be something to do with having two motherless daughters urging to him on with an indecent assault case worker, played above averagely by Geneviève Bujold. In addition to Bujold, Eastwood has support from Lennie Niehaus' score and Den Hadaya as his colleague Molinari. However the first is overwrought and the second underused. There are too many non sequitur cuts to allow Eastwood to rush off alone and the subplot that someone may be trying to frame him for the murders that he's investigating is abandoned before it even gets going.<br /><br />The film's too short but not if you're actually watching it... 3/10",unsup
11414_0,"There can be a deal of ambivalence in the relationship between cop and prostitute.Being a prostitute is not in itself an offence.Soliciting for the purpose of prostitution is an offence,running a brothel is an offence,living off immoral earnings is an offence.Nonetheless a cop can have a lot of power over a streetwalker.He can arrest her,hassle her,keep her moving on,blackmail her for freebies,even take money from her.And she has little recourse.Most cops chose to turn a blind eye to all but the most blatant soliciting unless under pressure from above or from concerned citizens.The same goes for sex shows and massage parlours.A few,like Detective Wes Block,are attracted by their defiant sexuality and availability and the freedom they represent to have random uncomplicated sexual relief on tap.Like Block these men are usually separated or divorced,middle - aged and wary of intimacy and commitment. Mr Clint Eastwood gives a first - rate performance as Block,father of two daughters,ashamed of his needs,sometimes loathing what they have turned him into.Only with his kids or his dogs - all capable of unconditional love - does he appear even remotely human. As a serial killer begins to mirror his movements,Block is forced to recognise what he has become. The movie is set in New Orleans which gives Mr Eastwood a chance to commission Mr Lennie Niehaus - former Stan Kenton alumnus - to compose a jazz - heavy score. It is not a movie full of snappy one - liners,dialogue is sparse and significant.Miss Genevieve Bujold is also excellent as the Rape Crisis Centre boss,outwardly a ball - breaker,but wanting to trust this odd cop who offers so many contradictions. Arguably the best performance comes from Alison Eastwood as Block's cusp - of - adolescence daughter. ""Tightrope""is a strange rather disturbing movie,but,if you can take it, a rewarding one.",unsup
11415_0,"Excellent film, Dark side we all have mixed with the Wes Block's warm heart at times was well placed to go with the Film's tone. I would highly recommend this to anyone into murder Mystery's. Eastwood is able to bring this character to life, his character Wes Block is a man on a mission, and he won't stop until he's got his man. To me the twists in this story can't be seen ahead of time, with just hints of foreshadowing, one is now taken along for the ride... <br /><br />Some may feel this film is dated, I would have to agree, it's like taking a journey back in time 25 years to New Orleans, Bourbon street during Halloween which was perfectly weaved into the story, simply brilliant,if you're looking for some high action ""Make my day"" shoot em up type of film this would not be the one for you. However if you have patience and a bit of a dark side I believe this film will satisfy your murder mystery cravings. 9/10<br /><br />Rated R for sexual content & violence",unsup
11416_0,"Troubled divorced Detective Wes Block (a bold and impressive performance by Clint Eastwood) investigates a brutal series of hooker murders in New Orleans. Said killings uncomfortably correspond with Block's own unsavory penchant for having kinky sex with prostitutes. Pretty soon Block is forced to confront head-on the more base and unappealing aspects of his own tormented psyche. Writer/director Richard Tuggle relates the compellingly sordid plot at a gradual, yet steady pace, develops a good deal of tension, delivers a vivid and intriguing evocation of the seamy Big Easy red light district, and, most of all, offers a strong and provocative exploration of the extremely warped and disturbing aspects of severely aberrant male sexuality and perversity (for example, Block likes to handcuff woman while making love to them in order to have a sense of control). Eastwood's Wes Block makes for a fascinatingly flawed and complex character: While he's a loving father to his two daughters (well played by Jennifer Beck and Clint's real-life daughter Alison), he nonetheless suffers from some seriously messed-up carnal hang-ups. Genevieve Bujold lends winningly sparky support as gutsy and hard-nosed rape-crisis therapist Beryl Thibodeaux; her witty exchanges with the macho Block are quite lively and amusing. Dan Hedaya also does well as Block's partner Detective Molinari. Ravishing redhead Jamie Rose, buxom blonde Randi Brooks, and equally busty blonde Rebecca Perle are very sexy and gorgeous as three of the killer's victims. The scenes between Block and his daughters are both funny and touching. Moreover, the nice sprinkling of tasty female nudity and deviant sex give this feature an extra seedy and twisted edge. The climactic confrontation between Block and the psycho is highly exciting and suspenseful. Bruce Surtees's sharp'n'shadowy cinematography gives the picture a suitably garish look. Lennie Niehaus' supremely bluesy and jazzy score likewise hits the spot. Moody and atmospheric, this seedy thriller rates as one of Clint Eastwood's most audacious and praiseworthy 80's films.",unsup
